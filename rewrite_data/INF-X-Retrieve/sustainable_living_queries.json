But there are a few other\nconsiderations to determine the best setting for your space.\n\n###  How long will the space need heat?\n\nThe principal benefit of an oil-filled radiator compared to other space heater\ntypes is in the capacity of the oil to retain and continue radiating heat for\nan hour or two after it has stopped consuming power. This means that it may\nnot be the best application for a space that only requires heat for an hour or\ntwo -- it takes time to heat up the oil, but once the oil is hot the heating\nelement only needs to switch on periodically to keep it at temperature so that\nit can heat the space. You may find that the heater doesn't warm the space\nduring the time you're there, and keeps warming it long after you leave -- an\ninefficient use of energy!\n\n###  How much heat does the space need?\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the **heating load** . This is the amount of\nheat energy that needs to be added to a space in order to maintain a specific\ntemperature. Heat load is a function of:\n\n  * Air infiltration (cold outside air leaking in through gaps around windows and doors) \n  * Insulation value \n  * Difference between desired temperature and outdoor air temperature \n  * Size of the room (how much air needs to be heated) \n  * Solar gains (sunlight heating the room through windows) \n  * Internal gains (things like people and appliances that passively heat the room) \n\nImagine the room like a leaky tank of water with a faucet keeping it full. The\nheat load is the net loss of water through the holes, and the flow from the\nfaucet must match this load to keep it full.\n\nFor your room, the heat load can be measured in watts, and your space heater\nsetting must exceed this value in order to be able to bring the room up to\ntemperature, and then maintain it.\n\nThe easiest way to determine the heat load is to test it with the heater.\nStart at the lowest setting (900 W) -- if this warms the room and keeps it\nwarm, then the heat load is around 900 W. There's no need to use a higher\nsetting, unless you want to more rapidly heat the room. This will also depend\non how cold it is outside, of course.\n\n###  Conclusion\n\n  * If the heat load of the space is higher than the heater setting, it's like pouring water into a tank with an outlet that's bigger than the inlet. \n  * If you only need the space warm for an hour or two, a simpler space heater would be faster and more effective. \n  * Otherwise, choose the lowest setting that brings the room up to the desired temperature."},

Many water heaters are set at the factory to 140 F / 60 C, which can increase the standby losses (energy spent keeping the water in the tank hot) up to 20% annually. You may find you need to mix in less hot water at the shower or sink, which reduces your usage as well. Note that anything lower than the recommended setting may increase your risk of [ Legionnaire's disease ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionnaires%27_disease#Reservoirs) . \n  2. **Insulate your hot water pipes.** Using [ pipe insulation ](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Pipe-Insulation/N-5yc1vZbuy9) on your hot water lines can result in savings of up to 4% annually, [ according to the DOE ](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/services/do-it-yourself-energy-savings-projects/savings-project-insulate-hot-water-pipes) . \n  3. **Insulate your hot water heater.** If the heater is warm to the touch, you may benefit from adding a [ water heater blanket ](https://www.homedepot.com/s/water%2520heater%2520blanket?NCNI-5) . Note that most modern hot water heaters have well-insulated tanks, and older water heaters only last 10 to 15 years, so this is unlikely to be a necessary upgrade (i.e., if your water heater is old enough to benefit from this, you might be better off saving your money for the imminent replacement water heater). \n  4. **Install a \"Shower Start\" shower-head.** [ Shower Start TSV ](https://www.thinkevolve.com/pages/showerstart-tsv) (no affiliation) is a special showerhead that reduces flow to a trickle when hot water arrives at the fixture. This way, you turn on the showerhead and collect the cold water with a bucket (for watering plants, flushing toilets, etc). When the flow reduces, you move the bucket and pull the lanyard to start your shower with warm water. \n  5. **Install a recirculating pump.** A retrofit recirculating pump is typically installed under the sink in the bathroom farthest (by pipe run length) from the water heater. The system works by pumping water from the hot water pipes into the cold water pipes, shutting off with a thermostat, so that water at the tap is hot when you open it. Older systems, intended to improve comfort, ran continually, or on a timer (keeping them on in the morning and evening), which wasted a lot of energy. There are now [ on demand systems ](https://www.plumbingsupply.com/on-demand-recirculating-pumps.html) with a push-button -- you simply press the button a few minutes before you want to shower. The pump does use energy, but it saves water, and reduces the chance of hot water going down the drain (since you can get right in the shower after turning it on, rather than waiting too long for the water to be hot). Note that they are relatively expensive, so probably not a good choice unless you have a large house or a lot of people taking showers with long gaps in between."},

If you\ndon't know the source of the electricity you can use the carbon intensity of\nthe average energy mix of the country where the server is located.\n\nIf you have many users from all over the world running your code on their\ndevices, you would need to use a world average carbon intensity. If data on\nwhere the users are coming from is available, you could refine this by\ncalculating a weighted world average carbon intensity. The latter could be\ndifficult as not all carbon footprints have the same scope, so you would need\na list of carbon intensities from many countries calculated in a uniform way.\n\n##  3\\. Optionally add emissions from other, low-impact activities\n\nDepending on the level of detail you are interested in, you could also\nestimate and subtract the emissions caused by writing your optimized code and\nputting it into production. However if your code is run very often, then the\nfootprint of producing it will be relatively small and in that case you can\nprobably leave it out.\n\nThere is also a small carbon footprint involved with [ storing data in the\ncloud ](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/6995/99) , so if there are\nbig changes there because of your improvement, that could also be included in\nthe calculation."},

Whilst the carbon in the leaves does\nreturn to the atmosphere when they break down and decay, that amount of carbon\nis tied into a cycle of being in the air, then in leaves, then breaking down,\nand returning to the air. The more leaves there are, the more carbon is in\nthat cycle rather than just building up in the atmosphere.\n\nOur one tonne tree, in any one year might have a tonne of CO2 sequestered in\nits leaves, and two tonnes sequestered in the dead leaves at its base and\nthree tonnes of CO2 in the air released from dead leaves waiting to be the\nnext years new leaves.

Methane and\n> other gases build up in this setting.**\n\nThe article notes that since 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [\nrequires large landfills to monitor methane emissions\n](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-\nbin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=9dd547da709a41416ae82bf206af61c9&mc=true&r=SECTION&n=se40.27.258_123)\n.

This\npractice is also seen in other countries around the world.\n\nIn summary, food that's sent to a landfill has a few options after it is\ndecomposed into methane gas:\n\n  1. Released into the atmosphere, where it is [ 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/)\n  2. Flared (burned), causing CO2 emissions and a waste of energy \n  3. Captured for use directly as biogas for heating or electricity generation -- the carbon content is still released to the atmosphere, but some of the energy is captured in the process \n\nWhile waste-to-energy systems are far better than the first two options, if\nthe main feedstock is wasted food, it is probably still worse than composting:\nburning methane puts carbon dioxide directly in the atmosphere, while\ncomposting puts at least a portion of it into the soil. In addition, food\nthat's composted for use at home doesn't required energy expenditure for\ntransport to a landfill, and offsets a portion of the demand for fertilizer.\n\nAnd ultimately, in modern agricultural systems, the energy to produce food\ncomes from oil, meaning that food waste is like pouring oil out on the ground.\nFrom Scientific American: [ Waste Land: Does the Large Amount of Food\nDiscarded in the U.S. Take a Toll on the Environment?\n](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talk-waste-land/)\n\n> [R]esearchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney\n> Diseases (NIDDK) concluded in a 2009 study that each year a quarter of U.S.\n> water consumption and over 300 million barrels of oil (four percent of U.S.\n> oil consumption) go into producing and distributing food that ultimately\n> ends up in landfills.\n\n* * *\n\n**What should we do instead?**\n\nFirst, **limit food waste** as much as possible:\n\n  * [ Any food and grocery buying systems that lead to less food waste? ](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2538/3379)\n\nSecond, **compost** to the extent practical:\n\n  * [ Is it feasible to compost in an apartment in a city like New York? ](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/7/3379)\n  * [ What alternative to composting is there to manage organic waste at home? ](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/226/3379)\n\nFinally, **advocate** !

In other words, 70-80% [ efficiency of large scale systems\n(wikipedia) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity) .\nThe big issue, though, is likely to be making it work at all. Conveniently\nthat wikipedia article has a small-scale example:\n\n> 1000 kilograms of water (1 cubic meter) at the top of a 100 meter tower has\n> a potential energy of about 0.272 kW·h\n\nTo make it useful you'd want to store as much energy as a modern small battery\nsystem, say 10kWh. Assuming your \"house\" is 100m tall (25-30 storeys), you get\n100m of head and using the 0.27kWh/m³, 10 kWh is about 40m³ (40,000 litres) of\nstorage. That's a small farm dam or big farm tank, it's definitely not a\nrainwater tank as most urban households think of it. Here's a pair of 38,000\nlitre tanks sitting in front of a house:\n\n[ ![9000 gallon water tank](https://i.sstatic.net/oX8N2.jpg)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/oX8N2.jpg)\n\nThe other problem is getting an efficient pump that can push water from your\nbottom 40m³ dam to the top 40m³ dam. Amazon will sell you a [ 2kW pump capable\nof 3m/hr to 100m ](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00M1NDCDG) for\n$1500. Efficiency is not very high - that's 2kWh input for 0.8kWh stored\n(3x0.272kWh from above). To get from 40% efficient to 90% efficient is going\nto cost a lot more, and if you're not 90% efficient on the storing side,\nyou're going to struggle to get 80% round-trip efficiency.\n\nNote that you can trade head for volume linearly, but the efficiency of your\npipes, pumps and turbines is crucial. The reason moderate head systems are\npreferred is that it's easier to get them up to the efficiency required. If\nyou have 1000 metres, or 10 metres, of head, it becomes very difficult to make\nthe system efficient. For example, most bore pumps with over 100m of head are\nsimply multistage versions of lower-head pumps, so the efficiency drops even\nfurther. But flow turbines for low-head systems usually peak at 70%-80%\nefficient rather than the 90% you can get out of a pelton wheel:\n\n[ ![water turbine efficiency graph](https://i.sstatic.net/NYEBN.jpg)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/NYEBN.jpg)\n\n( [ via wikidot ](http://waterturbines.wikidot.com/system:join) \\- relative\nefficiency of various turbines as flow rate varies as a proportion of rated)\n\nSo this is not something you can do at all as an urban household, and it will\nbe difficult for most rural landowners.\n\nWhen I had a microhydro system on a property I owned, I had about 20\nlitres/second available but the head was over 100m because the block of land\nwas steep (hence, cheap :)). The main limitation was my willingness to drag\nheavy pipe up a steep hill. Vehicle access to the top of the block was\nstrictly \"all wheel drive with winch\" and took a whole day - that sort of\nterrain is brilliant for hydro, but steep land with high rainfall is a\ndisaster for ground vehicles.\n\nBecause of the high rainfall, the \"reservoir\" at the top of that pipe was just\nan inlet filter anchored to bedrock using a cubic metre of concrete, there\nwasn't a dam per se, let alone storage. Getting the top anchor in place was\nover a months work for one man using machinery. Getting a tank like the one\nabove to the top would have needed a helicopter. A big, expensive helicopter\nthat would have had to come from a long way away. A dam would be easier, but\nstill ridiculously difficult."},

More for shorter periods or fitter people, obviously. Indurain is\nbelieved to have peaked at 2kW but he was exceptional even for a world\nchampion ( [ some people are fascinated by this stuff\n](http://sportsscientists.com/2009/07/tour-de-france-2009-power-estimates/) ).\nBut if you assume the average TV watcher can put out 150W for an evening\nyou're probably overestimating the average fitness and enthusiasm of\nnoncyclists. So let's say 100W per person.\n\nA DIY bicycle generator is likely to be less than 50% efficient, but 90% is\nachievable with a mass produced item. Unfortunately that's for the generator,\nnot the system. If you're charging a battery you then have a battery charger\nthat's 90% efficient and a battery that's 70-80% efficient (assuming high\nquality parts and design), so an overall efficiency of about 50%. If you feed\nthe grid instead you avoid all that and only need the generator-to-grid\ninverter which again will be 85-90% efficient. You need that even with a\nbattery, since you'll be using mains powered appliances.\n\nSo far we have 100W in, 80% efficiency (90% * 90%), 80W. Assume they can do\nthat for 4 hours after they've been at work all day. That's 320Wh of available\npower, or **0.3kWh per person** .\n\n**How much power do we use?** In [ Australia the average house\n](http://www.ipart.nsw.gov.au/Home/For_Consumers/Compare_Energy_Offers/Typical_household_energy_use)\nuses about 7kWh per person per day (1400kWh/quarter divided by 91 days per\nquarter for 1-2 people = 15, 2100 for 3-4 people = 23). The [ US uses a little\nmore ](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3) and here's [ figures\naround the world per year ](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-\nelectricity-consumption) . For the USA 4500kWh/365 days = 12kWh/day for each\nperson.\n\nSo the average USA resident would need to pedal for 12.3kWh/0.08kW = **154\nhours per day** (slightly less than a week assuming no breaks, or about two\nweeks of normal working hours - a 72 hour working week). The average\nAustralian would only have to pedal for 87 hours a day.\n\n> Should the answer be \"Impossibly long,\" what could be improved: the bike,\n> the generator, or the batteries?\n\nNone of those make the slightest difference. A 100% efficient bike, generator,\nbattery and inverter would reduce the time required by 25%, so instead of\nneeding a team of 20 people pedalling each day, your American would only need\n16.\n\n**The easy wins here are efficiency** . If instead of driving their electric\ncar (not included above) they simply rode a bicycle to work they'd use less\nthan 1/10th the energy, even allowing for the extra food they might eat (most\nAmericans eat more than they need to).\n\nA lot of that electricity is use to heat and cool houses. If people lived in\nproperly built homes that were designed for the weather they experience they\nwould use dramatically less energy. The [ PassivHaus\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house) standard, for example, allows\n15kWh per year for heating and cooling, so assuming two residents they'd use\nless energy in a year than many American houses use in a day. Building to\nPassiveHaus standards is hard, though, because if you \"need\" the ridiculous\nfloor area that Australian and US homes have you also need a ridiculous level\nof insulation and it costs a ridiculous amount of money. So don't do that.\nSettle for less than 100 square metres per person (about 1000 square feet) and\nit's much easier.\n\nPersonally we have energy audited our lifestyle to a fairly high level even by\ngreen geek standards, so my household uses about 15kWh/day for a household of\nfour (slightly over 1/2 the Australian average, 1/4 the US average). We could\ncut that in half again by getting a solar hot water system (we live in\n_Australia_ , solar is the obvious choice) and we will do that as soon as we\ncan afford it. We are also planning on building a \"granny flat\" in the back\nyard that my partner and I will live it. At about 45 square metres (450 square\nfeet) and to PassivHaus standards it will cost about 30% more than a standard\none, and should not require heating or cooling at all. With solar water\nheating we are confident of using less than 2kWh/day per person.\n\nIf we can cut our use to 2kWh/day each, that's still 20 hours a day on the\nbike at 100W. But I'm pretty fit and even at my post-peak age I can still put\nout 200W for a couple of hours. So say I do three hours a day at 200W...\nthat's 0.6kWh/day when I'm using 2.\n\n**Or I could buy a solar PV system** . Excluding subsidies, those cost about\n$US1/watt installed and generate 3Wh/Wday. Even if I double the size so in the\nmiddle of winter I'm generating most of what I use, 2KWh/day means I need less\nthan 1kW of panels and with four people in the house a 4kW system costing\nabout $US4000. And I can sit on the couch rather than sweating it out, because\nI ride about 90 minutes a day to and from work already.\n\nThe embodied energy cost of the two systems is likely to be similar as well.\nWhile a single bicycle system is smaller (and therefore likely to have less\nembodied energy), you need many more of them.\n\nA [ UK TV program ](http://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/powering-your-\nentire-home-by-bike-the-bbc-explores-cheap-energy-video.html) actually used\nteams of people on pedal generators to power a house.

It states that\na 1000 lb horse will produce about 9.1 tons of manure a year. Additionally,\neach horse needs about 10 to 20 pounds of bedding each day. If you assume 15\npounds of bedding per day on average, that's 2.7 tons per year. Combine this\nwith the amount of manure each horse produces and it's 11.8 tons of waste each\nyear.

With so much manure to dispose, it ground water can easily become\ncontaminated.\n\nAdditional problems produced by horses are what to do with the numerous\nquantities of horses that will die each year.\n\nThe removal of horses from urban environments has resulted in one of the major\nimprovements in human health. The permanent removal of horse manure from urban\nenvironments has significantly reduced the amount of disease carrying flies in\ncities and towns. Also, people in cities and towns no longer have to deal with\nsmell of horse manure and urine or avoid having to step in horse manure or\nurine as they walk around town.\n\nThe other aspect of horse manure is that horses need to eat. According the\nEric Morris, each horse needs about 1.4 tons of oats and 2.4 tons of hay each\nyear. That's 3.6 tons of food each year. Rutger's University uses a figure of\n25 pounds of dry feed per horse each day; that's 4.56 tons per year. Growing\nthat much food for horses will require a lot of land."},

I read one study that in Tennessee it would\nbe possible to raise enough hardwood on the area they were strip mining to\npower the generators indefinitely. But not as cheaply, but it's much newer\ntech.\n\nSo for sugar cane, it is quite reasonable to extract the juice from the cane,\nspread the crushed cane out to dry as much as reasonable for your climate,\nthen use that cane for process heat to dry the sap, or to generate power. The\nmost efficient use would probably be to generate power and use the waste heat\nfrom power generation to dry the sap. Some of these options would require long\nterm storage of either the raw sap, or the cane. This might make the process\nuneconomical.\n\nFor corn it would be reasonable to harvest, let the stalks dry in the field,\nthen bale them until ready to be burned. The problem: A 1 GW power plant takes\na LOT of agricultural waste to fuel. Lots of short haul transport. Even with\ncoal with it's higher density is expensive enough to haul, that where possible\nthey put the power plant next to the mine wherever possible.\n\nCorn is a high nutrient crop. Some of those nutrients stay in the leaves.\nEcologically expensive biomass. Switchgrass is one that is promoted as a\nbiofuel crop. In fall the plant salvages most of the minerals back out of the\ngrass. Little there but cellulose and lignan.\n\nThe big win on biochar is to plough it back into the ground. The evidence is\nstill unclear as to all of it's advantages, but first looks:\n\n  * It's a sponge for water. In climates where late rain means no crop this may make a difference. \n\n  * It's a sponge of nutrients. In climates with heavy rainfall, this can reduce nutrient leaching from the soil. \n\n  * It is stable in the soil. Where compost turns back into fungi food in months to years, charcoal seems to be stable for centuries. \n\nIn principle it should be possible to produce biochar as a byproduct of\nagricultural waste power generation. (Make the char, use the syngas as the\nprocess heat for making the char, and for heating livestock barns. Use surplus\nsyngas to generate power.) This minimises the hauling problem, but means you\nare stuck with smaller less efficient power plants.\n\nIn practice, I've not seen units for sale that were automatic enough for\npractical use.\n\nThere's some indication that soot in dust may not be good for you. Also that\nwith sufficient charcoal in the soil, the very soil can burn. (Even in fire\nsuccession forests such as our lodgepole pine, seem to be on mineral soils.\nEvery few fires you get one hot enough to burn the soil.)"},

You can make it feel narrower by using taller and more\nconspicuous sides (eg like the movable barriers in the photo rather than just\nroad cones).\n\nIt's hard to understand what damage has been done from a photo taken in such\nwet weather. Also, it would be useful to know what it was previously like.\n\nMy understanding is that the most cost effective way to repair or rebuild can\ndepend heavily on how you measure the cost (if you're the government, then\nincreased productivity essentially offsets cost, for example), what labour and\nmachinery costs, and what materials are available (and how far away they are,\nand their transportation costs).\n\nAt a high level, optimising the benefits of the road for affordable cost is\ncalled Road Asset Management, which also fall under the category of [\nInfrastructure Asset Management\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_asset_management) . An example\nof what's involved, for sealed roads, [ is available here\n](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/chipsealing-new-zealand-\nmanual/docs/05-road-asset-management.pdf) from the New Zealand Transport\nAgency (which looks after NZ's State Highways).\n\nIf I understand it correctly, the first step in managing an asset is to start\nrecording measurements about the asset so that you understand how it's\nchanging, how much is being spent to maintain it, and in what way."},

  {"query": " Explain biological treatment systems, such as biofilters, commonly used for treating grey water to remove organic compounds and convert it into potable water, focusing on biological degradation and cost-effectiveness.", "reasoning": "To deal with grey water with cheapest and easiest way, it may be related to wastewater treatment in scalable ways, e.g., through biofiltration.", "id": "91", "excluded_ids": ["N/A"], "gold_ids_long": ["grey_water/22508136.txt"], "gold_ids": ["grey_water/22508136_126.txt"], "gold_answer": "This is a very open ended question. Much of this depends on the scale of\noperation, and your climate.\n\nYou specifically said grey water, so I'm assuming this means laundry,\ndishwater and bathwater. The chief grey components are going to be food waste,\nbody dirt, and soap. There will be a minor component of oil or grease.\n\nA good system would have a float separation of grease. Run the effluent into a\nlarge tank. Both input and output should be several inches below the surface.\nThe tank should be sized to hold several day's waste water. Inlet and outlets\nshould be designed to not stir up the water much. Using 4\" pipe with lots of\n3/4\" holes is a good way to do this. (2 feet of pipe with 6 holes every 3\ninches.)\n\nYou can check if you need this by taking some samples of grey water in a\nbucket, and see if a film of grease forms on the surface. If no grease forms,\nthen you don't need this step.\n\nAfter the grease separation, run it through a straw column. Build this with a\ncouple of plastic barrels. Every 6\" in height run 3 chunks of small diameter\nABS sewer line through the barrel, alterting direction each level. These fit\nloosely into holes in the barrel, as you need to remove them periodically to\nadd straw. On one side drill 3/4 inch holes every 2.5 inches. Fill the column,\ninserting the pipes as needed, hole side down. This keeps the column from\ncollapsing into a sodden mess, and allows air into the column. Your effluent\nis sprayed onto the top of the straw collumn at the rate of a couple gallons a\nminute. You will need a small storage tank -- enough for a day's use, and a\nfloat switch to operate the pump. You need to either use a pump that can\nhandle solids, or you need to put a filter before the pump. You will have to\nreplace the straw in the column a couple times a year. Add to the compost\npile.\n\nAlternative way: Pile of straw on 4 pallets. Pallets are on a tarp. Tarp\ndrains into edge of pond.\n\nRun it to long, narrow shallow pond. The pond should be between 12 and 18\"\ndeep. Plant the pond with cattails. They will remove most of the phosphates\nfrom the soap, and generally remove harmful bacteria.\n\nA second pond that acts as storage until you need the water. Having duckweed\nin this pond will act as a secondary biofilter.\n\nTo use the water first you need to filter it. Do this in several stages. First\nstage is a trash filter. This is a coarse mesh filter that keeps chunks out of\nthe plumbing. Availalbe at any farm store. This filter should be on a float,\nwith the filter itself about a foot to two feet under the surface.\n\nSecondary filter is a screen filter. These are availble in mesh sizes from\nabout 40 to about 150. You may need several in series with progressively finer\nmeshes. Get ones that you don't have to disassemble to clean, but that you can\njust back flush.\n\nTertiary filtering can be either a sand filter or a disk filter.\n\nAt this point you need to start taking water samples and send them off for\nchecks for bacterial contamination. Most pubic health offices in rural\nlocations can do this for you. Contact them for sampling technique. If the\nbacteria count is too high, you can either use bleach or UV or ozone as a\npurifying step.\n\nHowever the water is clean enough at the end of the cattails to use as water\nfor your lawn and garden. Filter enough for whatever pumping system you use.\n\nCaveats: Pond based filters don't work when they are frozen. If you live in a\nclimate with consistend sub freezing or near freezing conditions, then you\nneed to size your ponds to hold a year's water supply. You will also need to\nadd a pump to circulate the water during the good part of the year. It doesn't\nhave to circulate very fast. Once a week will do.\n\nNumbers: Family of 4. 1 load of dishes (20 gal) 4 baths (150 gal) 2 batches of\nlaundry (50 gal). Misc other 30 gal. Total 200 gallons. That's about 25 cubic\nfeet. A 1 year pond then will need 400 x 25 (rounding days per year up) =\n10,000 cubic feet. If the pond is 2 feet deep that's 5000 square feet. If you\nmake the pond 10 feet wide it's 500 feet long. You can make the pond\nserpentine, so it fits into an area 50 x 100 feet. Or you can make it wander\naround the edge of your property as a water feature.\n\nTo circulate the water on a once a week basis during the thawed season you\nneed to move 10,000 cubic feet / 600,000 seconds -- about a half a quart per\nsecond, or about 6 gallons a minute. You can use larger flows for the sunny\npart of the day and run it off a PV cell. There is very little height\ndifference between one end and the other. Main power loss will be friction in\nthe piping. You want low head pumps. Heating system circulation pumps, or\naquarium pumps are candidates. Take the time to calcuate the power usage. It's\ngoing to run a LOT of hours.\n\nIf you have a moderate climate, you can put the water based bio filter in a\ngreen house. This will keep it active all year, or at most a much shorter down\ntime. This means you don't need to store a year's worth of pond, but only a\nweek or two. Make the green house twice as large as necessary, and attach it\nto the house as a sun room. This will provide some heat for the house, and\ngive a pleasant place on a winter's day. Plastic sheathed hoop houses are\ninexpensive to build.\n\nFurther info: Wastewater treatment biofilter layouts compared.

Some impact categories to think about: carbon\nfootprint/global warming potential, energy consumption, ecotoxicity, human\nhealth, water consumption. All of these are pretty commonly used. There is a\nlot of research on LCA methods, both on how to collect the basic data and how\nto transform it into these impact categories. Two common methods include the\nEPA's [ TRACI ](http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html) or the european\n[ ReCiPe ](http://www.lcia-recipe.net/) . Ideally, LCA's provide a\nquantitative and clear answer, but that's rarely true - they are quantitative\nthough, which is really important.\n\nFor some of your later questions, particularly around batteries, the answers\nwill depend on the study. The technical terms here are allocation and boundary\nconditions. Do we model battery recycling? who gets the benefits of it? what\ntechnologies are we looking at, and what other products do those produce? What\nimpacts or processes do we include or exclude?

New hybrids have much lower impacts than the\noriginals, and keeping the car longer will definitely decrease the relative\nimpact (one of the assumptions is about how long cars last).
