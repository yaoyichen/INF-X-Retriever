If you can connect a particular waveform to a particular event\nin the brain through other means, though, you may be able to infer that a\ngiven signal is primarily excitatory or inhibitory, but not directly from MEG\nitself. The Wikipedia article on MEG talks a bit about how this all works and\nhow some level of synchrony is necessary for MEG to work: [\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography) Mostly, it works\nbecause of the orientation of neurons and flow within dendrites rather than\nacross membranes. Here's a paint-quality diagram:\n\n[ ![Current flow](https://i.sstatic.net/pghGx.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/pghGx.png)\n\nOn the left, positive ions enter a dendrite (black arrows). This causes a net\npositive flow down the dendrite (red solid arrow). On the right, negative ions\nenter a dendrite somewhere else (black arrows). This causes a net positive\nflow in the same direction. MEG is measuring synchronous red solid arrow\ncurrent flow over many many of these parallel dendrites.\n\nSecond, most IPSPs in the brain are [ shunting inhibition\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_inhibition) ; they don't create much\nnet current or voltage change at all, rather they help to maintain membrane\npotential near the chloride reversal which is near a typical rest potential.\n\nIn any event, the things that MEG or EEG measure are typically rhythmic brain\nactivity, and we know this sort of activity results from a combination of\ninhibition and excitation anyways. So, while it's true that one can't directly\nmeasure EPSPs or IPSPs, that's not at all what these techniques measure. It's\nsort of like saying that a scale can't tell you how tall you are."},

The decline\nin hearing sensitivity is mainly caused by the **[ loss of hair cells\n](https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/specialties/ear-nose-and-throat/for-\npatients/how-ear-works/inner-and-outer-hair-cells) ** . Hair cells are sensory\ncells in the inner ear that convert acoustic vibrations into electrical\nsignals.

That is because the\nlack of speech is not due to a problem with the sensory or communication parts\nof the nervous system. The problem lies in anxiety. Kids with selective mutism\nare perfectly capable of detecting, understanding, and producing speech. Many\nof them won't talk at all in one setting, but will be little chatterboxes in\nother settings, so long as they feel safe and comfortable there. It's the\nanxiety that prevents them from speaking. If we remove anxiety, we remove the\ncommunication difficulties.\n\nHOWEVER, that's not to say that there can't be some co-occurring problem that\nimpacts speech IN ADDITION to the anxiety. Lots of kids with selective mutism\ndo also have some actual neurobiological communication difficulties.\nTechnically a diagnosis of a communication disorder rules out selective\nmutism, but they can definitely co-occur, so long as you determine that the\nanxiety is also a contributing factor (which kinda brings me back to my first\npoint about diagnoses.

Nature\nReviews Neuroscience, 14(3), 202-216.\n](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3444)\n\nOne way to classify some of these interneurons is by their expression of\nparticular genes. Using that scheme, it then becomes common for, say,\n\"Parvalbumin-expressing cells\" (=cells that have parvalbumin protein/mRNA) to\nget shortened into just \"Parvalbumin cells\" or \"Parvalbumin interneurons\" or\n\"PV+ cells\", etc.\n\nIt's not necessary that these proteins that are used to name cell types are\nparticularly crucial to their function; for PV cells, it seems like it is,\nbecause one feature of PV cells is that they have very fast\nelectrophysiological kinetics, and some of those fast kinetics are assisted by\nthe calcium binding of parvalbumin. For somatostatin interneurons, it's less\nclear; somatostatin is certainly an important gut hormone, but it's not\nparticularly clear why somatostatin-expressing neurons form a particular\nimportant subclass of cells in the brain, as most known functions of\nsomatostatin are restricted to development or the gut.\n\n##  Back to the Question\n\n> So is this saying they recorded activity from inhibitory interneurons that\n> were ... releasing? producing? ...

They aren't necessarily interested in either SST protein or VIP\nprotein, but these have served as markers/names for particular cell\npopulations.

It only looked at SSRIs and lamictal for\nmedication though.\n\nThere's also a [ 2016 RCT on N-acetylcysteine\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007062) , published in a high-impact\njournal, concluding:\n\n> N-acetylcysteine [NAC] treatment resulted in significant reductions in skin-\n> picking symptoms and was well tolerated.\n\nThe result was [ fairly unsurprising\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325313/) given that NAC was\npreviously found effective for trichotillomania (TTM -- hair pulling) as well;\nboth studies with NAC were conducted by the same research group. But there\nwere a few more interesting comments on those papers:\n\n> In striking contrast with what we know about OCD, SSRIs have not been proved\n> to be superior to placebo in TTM treatment. As for ED, the evidence\n> regarding the efficacy of SSRIs is still scarce. **So far, there are no US\n> Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for ED** and TTM. The\n> divergent results of the trials testing either SSRIs or NAC for ED/TTM and\n> OCD suggest that treatments may not be used interchangeably between OCD and\n> related disorders.\n>\n> In addition, results from genetic studies also suggest that the neurobiology\n> of pathological grooming may not be necessarily related to OCD. It had been\n> demonstrated that Sapap3 knockout mice groomed themselves excessively.\n> However, using family-based association analyses, [ Bienvenu et al\n> ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19051237) found that variation within\n> the human equivalent of the Sapap3 gene appeared associated with ED/TTM, but\n> not with OCD. The conflicting results regarding the efficacy of NAC for\n> ED/TTM and OCD, in addition to the findings of translational studies,\n> suggest that the neural basis of repetitive behaviors observed in patients\n> with these disorders might not be the same. So far, similarities between\n> ED/TTM and OCD do not seem to go beyond the characterization by repetitive\n> behaviors and some degree of familial aggregation.\n\n(But note that this last statement appears somewhat incorrect in view of the [\n2017 neuroimaging study\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604737/) \\--some overlap with\nOCD seems to exist after all.)\n\nNHS Choices also has consumer-oriented page on [ \"Skin picking disorder \"\n](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/skin-picking-disorder/) which doesn't say much\nI haven't told you already except for some behavioral tips.

In the third type, the content of the experience is not at the\n> foreground, but the subject has the feeling of a known sensation or a state\n> of consciousness similar to night dreaming. Only the first two types should\n> be called déjà-rêvé, while the last type should be referred to as “dreamy\n> state”.\n\nThey also discuss why déjà-rêvé is apparently not simply a hallucination,\nbasically because of the association of the phenomenon with electrode\nplacement in memory- and dream-related brain regions:\n\n> It may be disputed that we cannot be sure that déjà-rêvé (episodic-like or\n> familiarity-like) are linked to true previous dreams. EBS could simply\n> produce a random combination of visual and auditory elements, creating\n> phantasmagoric and unrealistic experiences similar to dreams. However, EBS-\n> inducing déjà-rêvé were all located in the temporal lobes, although\n> extratemporal brain areas were commonly stimulated [4].
