More recent work\n(e.g., [ Frasnelli 2013\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859130/) ) has also shown that\nlateralization can also occur in invertebrates. In other words, \"handedness\"\n(or pawedness, footedness, eyedness, earedness, nostriledness, toothedness,\nbreastedness, gonadedness, etc.) occurs rather extensively across the animal\nkingdom.\n\n  * These studies suggest that the evolution of [ brain lateralization ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function) , often linked to lateralized behaviors, may have occurred early in evolutionary history and may not have been the result of multiple independent evolutionary events as once thought. \n\n  * Although this view of brain lateralization as a highly conserved trait throughout evolutionary history has gained popularity, it's still contested (reviewed by [ Bisazza et al. 1998 ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lesley_Rogers2/publication/13705331_The_Origins_of_Cerebral_Asymmetry_A_Review_of_Evidence_of_Behavioural_and_Brain_Lateralization_in_Fishes_Reptiles_and_Amphibians/links/00b4951d6271266e30000000.pdf) ; [ Vallortigara et al. 1999 ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lesley_Rogers2/publication/12775736_Possible_evolutionary_origins_of_cognitive_brain_lateralization/links/00b4951d62712bc632000000/Possible-evolutionary-origins-of-cognitive-brain-lateralization.pdf) ). \n\nNote: Laterality of function may manifest in terms of preference (frequency)\nor performance (proficiency), with the former being far more often\ninvestigated.\n\nAnd no, right-handedness is not always dominant.\n\n**But Why?**\n\n  * One hypothesis is that brain lateralization was the evolutionary result of the need to break up complex tasks and perform them with highly specialized neuronal units to avoid functional overlap (i.e., to account for \"functional incompatibility\"). \n\n  * In humans, [ many hypotheses ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness) have been developed including: division of labor, genetics, epigenetic factors, prenatal hormone exposure, prenatal vestibular asymmetry, and even ultrasound exposure in the womb. \n\n  * Snake studies (see below) have suggested lateralization behavior can be dictated by environmental conditions (specifically, temperature). \n\n  * Other work ( [ Hoso et al. 2007 ](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/3/2/169.full.pdf) ) suggest that lateralization could be the result of convergent evolution.

(1992)\n](http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf)\nreport that the identification of a target area with a different _texture_ or\n_orientation pattern_ was performed better by dichromats when the surfaces\nwere painted with irrelevant colors. In other words, when color is simply a\ndistractor and confuses the subject to focus on the task (i.e., texture or\norientation discrimination), the lack of red-green color vision can actually\nbe beneficial. This in turn could be interpreted as dichromatic vision being\nbeneficial over trichromatic vision to **detect color-camouflaged objects** .\n\nReports on improved foraging of dichromats under low-lighting are debated, but\ncannot be excluded. The better camouflage-breaking performance of dichromats\nis, however, an established phenomenon [ (Cain _et al_ ., 2010)\n](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/36) .\n\nDuring the Second World War it was suggested that color-deficient observers\ncould often penetrate camouflage that deceived the normal observer. The idea\nhas been a recurrent one, both with respect to military camouflage and with\nrespect to the camouflage of the natural world (reviewed in [ Morgan _et al_ .\n(1992)\n](http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf)\n\n**Outlines** , rather than colors, are responsible for **pattern recognition**\n.

If you sit back\nfar from your screen, look at the normal full-color picture on the left and\ncompare it to the dichromatic picture on the right; the picture on the right\nappears at higher contrast in trichromats, but dichromats may not see any\ndifference between the two:\n\n[ ![dichromatic camouflage](https://i.sstatic.net/y5hhC.jpg)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/y5hhC.jpg)  \nLeft: full-color image, right: dichromatic image. source: [ De Paul University\n](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/colorvisiondefi.htm)\n\nHowever, I think the dichromat trait is simply **_not selected against_ **\nstrongly and this would explain its existence more easily than finding reasons\nit would be selected **_for_ ** [ (Morgan _et al_ ., 1992)\n](http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf) .\n\n**References**  \n**-** [ Cain _et al_ ., _Biol Lett_ (2010); **6** , 3–38\n](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/36)  \n**-** [ Morgan _et al_ ., _Proc R Soc B_ (1992); **248** : 291-5\n](http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf)"},

There are\nseveral things to consider when we think of how genes that cause disease,\naging, and death to evolve.\n\nOne explanation for the evolution of aging is the [ **mutation accumulation**\n( **MA** ) ](http://www.programmed-\naging.org/theories/mutation_accumulation.html) hypothesis. This hypothesis by\nP. Medawar states that mutations causing late life deleterious (damaging)\neffects can build up in the genome more than diseases that cause early life\ndisease. This is because selection on late acting mutations is weaker.\nMutations that cause early life disease will more severely reduce the fitness\nof its carrier than late acting mutations. For example, if we said in an\nimaginary species that all individuals cease to reproduce at 40 years old and\na mutation arises that causes a fatal disease at 50 years old then selection\ncan not remove it from the population - carriers will have as many children as\nthose who do not have the gene. Under the mutation accumulation hypothesis it\nis then possible for mutations to [ drift\n](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIDGeneticdrift.shtml) through\nthe population.\n\nAnother hypothesis which could contribute to aging is the [ **antagonistic\npleiotropy** ( **AP** )\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis) hypothesis\nof G.C. Williams. [ Pleiotropy ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy) is\nwhen genes have more than one effect, such genes tend to cause correlations\nbetween traits, height and arm length probably have many of the same genes\naffecting them, otherwise there would be no [ correlation between arm length\nand height ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8793422) (though environment\nand linkage can also cause these patterns)... Back to AP as an explanation for\naging, if a gene improves fitness early in life, but causes late life disease\nit can spread through the population via selection. The favourable early\neffect spreads well because of selection and, just as with MA, selection can\nnot \"see\" the late acting disease.\n\nUnder both MA and AP the key point is that selection is less efficient at\nremoving late acting deleterious mutations, and they may spread more rapidly\nthanks to beneficial early life effects. Also if there is extrinsic mortality\n(predation etc.) then the effect of selection is also weakened on alleles that\naffect late life. The same late-life reduction in the efficacy of selection\nalso slows the rate at which alleles increasing lifespan spread.\n\nA third consideration is the [ **disposable-soma model**\n](http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/disposable_soma.html) , a\ndescription by T. Kirkwood of life-history trade-offs which might explain why\naging and earlier death could be favoured. The idea is that individuals have a\nlimited amount of resources available to them - perhaps because of\nenvironmental constraints or ability to acquire/allocate the resources. If we\nthen assume that individuals have to use their energy for two things, staying\nalive via repair and maintenance (somatic-maintenance) and making offspring\n(reproductive-investment), then any energy devoted to one will take away from\nthe other. If an individual carries a gene that makes it devote all of its\nenergy to somatic maintenance then its fitness will be very low (probably 0!)\nand that gene will not spread. If the level of maintenance required to live\nforever costs more energy than an individual can spare without suffering from\nlow fitness (very likely) or can even acquire and efficiently convert in the\nfirst place (also very likely) then high-maintenance alleles will not spread\n(and aging & death will continue to occur).\n\nTo go a little further, it is common for sexes to age differently (this is\nwhat I work on) and one possible explanation is that the sexes favour\ndifferent balances of the trade off between somatic-maintenance and\nreproductive investment, this can lead to conflict over the evolution of genes\naffecting this balance and slow the rates of evolution to sex specific optima.\n[ This paper\n](http://www.cosmoid.de/zajitschek/papers/Bonduriansky2008FunctionalEcology.pdf)\nprovides a good review of the area.\n\n**To summarise** , evolution has not managed to get rid of death via genetic\ndisease etc. (intrinsic mortality) because the effect is only weakly selected\nagainst, and those alleles may provide some early life benefit, and resource\nlimitation may also reduce the potential to increase lifespan due to trade-\noffs with reproductive effort. Adaptive evolution is not about the _survival_\nof the fittest but the _reproduction_ of the fittest - the fittest allele is\nthe one which spreads the most effectively.\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks to Remi.b for also pointing out some other considerations.\n\nAnother thought is that of altruistic aging - aging for the good of the\npopulation (the population is likely to contain related individuals, _you_ are\nrelated to all other humans to some degree). In this model aging is an\nadaptive process (unlike in MA where it is just a consequence of weak\nselection). By dying an individual makes space for it's offspring/relatives to\nsurvive (because resources are then less likely to limit populations). This\nwill stop excessive population growth which could lead to crashes in the\npopulation and so, by dying earlier, an individual promotes the likelihood\nthat its progeny will survive. Arguments of altruistic sacrifice are often\nhard to promote but [ recent work suggests that this is a more plausible model\nthan once thought\n](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255170953_Viscous_populations_evolve_altruistic_programmed_aging_in_ability_conflict_in_a_changing_environment)\n.\n\n[ Evolvabilty theories ](http://www.programmed-\naging.org/theories/evolvability_theories.html) also suggest that aging is an\nadaptive process. These suggest that populations, composed of a mixture of\nyoung and old, have biases in how well adapted the members of the population\nare - where younger individuals are better adapted (because they were produced\nmore recently it is likely that the environment is similar to the environment\nthey are favoured in). Thus by removing the less well adapted individuals from\na population via senescence and freeing up resources for younger better\nadapted individuals, a population evolves more rapidly towards it optimal\nstate."},

This is an elegant biological algorithm which\nexplains all branching growth.**\n\nThe things Konrad identifies (phototropism, gravitropism, etc.) serve as\norientation cues which help the plant determine which axes to grow along, but\nfundamentally the process is about auxin gradients. There are exceptions, as\nothers have pointed out in their answers, and they usually result from severe\nimbalances in the orientation cues.\n\nI'll try to explain the growth process clearly (and it gives me an opportunity\nto try my hand at diagramming again ^_^)...\n\n* * *\n\nAuxin is a plant hormone (actually a class of hormones, but mostly when people\nsay auxin, they mean [ indole-3-acetic acid\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole-3-acetic_acid) ) which promotes cell\nelongation and division. The basic principle which allows auxin to act in the\norganising way it does is that auxin is produced inside cells, and proteins\nwhich export auxin from a cell develop on the side of the cell which has the\nhighest auxin concentration (see figure below).\n\n![cells export auxin more on the side which has the highest auxin\nconcentration](https://i.sstatic.net/VGbXI.png)\n\n**So auxin gets transported up the concentration gradient of auxin!** Thus if\nyou get an area of high auxin concentration developing somehow, more auxin is\nthen transported towards that area. An area of high auxin concentration\nrelative to the surrounding tissue is called an **auxin maximum** (plural\n'maxima').\n\nFor most of the life of the plant, auxin is produced pretty much equally in\nmost cells. However, at the very early stages of embryo development, it gets\nproduced preferentially along the embryonic axis (see figure below, **part 1**\n). That creates a **meristem** \\- a group of cells where cell division is\ntaking place - at the auxin maximum at each end of the embryo. Since this\nparticular meristem is at the apex of the plant, it is called the **apical\nmeristem** , and it is usually the strongest one in the plant.\n\n![auxin patterning of plant growth](https://i.sstatic.net/bSY6i.png)\n\nSo by having a meristem at each end, the embryo then elongates as cell\ndivision is only taking place at those points. This leads to **part 2** of the\nimage above, where the two meristems get so far apart that the auxin gradient\nis so weak as to no longer have its organising effect (area in the red\nsquare). When that happens, the auxin produced in cells in that area\nconcentrates in a chaotic way for a short time until another center of\ntransport is created. This happens, as the first one did, when a particular\narea of the tissue has a slightly higher concentration of auxin, and so auxin\nin the surrounding tissue is transported towards it. This leads to **part 3**\nof the figure, in which two new meristems are created on the sides of the\nplant (called **lateral meristems** ).\n\nLateral meristems are where branches occur on plants. If you then imagine this\nprocess continuing to iterate over and over, you will see that the branches,\nas they elongate, will develop meristems at the tips and along the sides. The\nmain stem will also continue elongating, and develop more lateral stems. The\nroot will begin to branch, and those branches will branch, etc. If you can\nunderstand how this elegant system works, you understand how plants grow, and\nwhy they grow in repeating units as opposed to in a body plan like animals.\n\nIt also explains why, if you cut off the tip of a stem, it promotes branching.\nBy removing the apical meristem, you get rid of the auxin gradient and enable\nthe creating of multiple smaller meristems which each develop into branches.\n\nSo far I've explained regular branching, but the same system causes the radial\nsymmetry which makes trees (usually) grow in all directions equally...\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/81e6B.png)\n\nImagine taking a cross section through a stem and looking down all the way\nthrough it (as depicted crudely above). Just as auxin gradients act to\ncoordinate growth along the length of the plant, they also coordinate it\nradially, as the maxima will tend to space themselves out as far from one\nanother as possible. That leads to branches growing in all directions equally\n(on average).\n\nI welcome comments on this answer, as I think its so important to\nunderstanding plant growth that I'd like to hone my answer to make it as good\nas possible."},

As far as I am aware, _asphyxiation_\nresults in _excitotoxicity_ , which causes unconsciousness, brain damage and\neventually, death.\n\n**Background**  \n**_[ Asphyxia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia) _ ** is a condition of\nthe body that occurs from severely inadequate oxygen supply, or because of\nexcessive carbon dioxide in the body ( [ First Aid and CPR courses\n](http://firstaidandcprcourses.ca/asphyxia-causes-signs-and-symptoms-\ncomplications-and-first-aid-management/) ). The **brain** is the organ **most\nsensitive** to hypoxia ( [ Medscape\n](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1988699-overview#a3) ). **Nerve\ncells** in the brain can **survive only up to four minutes** without oxygen (\n[ First Aid and CPR courses ](http://firstaidandcprcourses.ca/asphyxia-causes-\nsigns-and-symptoms-complications-and-first-aid-management/) ). Consciousness\nis lost after approximately three minutes ( [ Forensic Pathology\n](http://www.forensicpathologyonline.com/E-Book/asphyxia/drowning) ).\nPermanent brain damage begins after approximately 4 minutes without oxygen,\nand death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later ( [ Medline\n](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000013.htm) ). Asphyxial\ndeaths typically involve respiratory arrest with [ bradycardia\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia) / [ asystole\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asystole) (low heart rate / cardiac arrest)\nbecause of the **hypoxia-induced dysfunction of the respiratory centers in the\nbrainstem** ( [ Forensic Pathology\n](http://www.forensicpathologyonline.com/E-Book/asphyxia/drowning) ).\n\nDespite the small size of the brain (2% of body weight), it is, however, the\nlargest consumer of total body oxygen (20%) and glucose (25%), which are\ndelivered by 15% of the total cardiac output [ (Schur & Rigor, 1998)\n](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778571) .\n\nA lack of oxygen may result in so called [ hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\n](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/973501-overview) (HIE), i.e., neuronal\ncell death due to hypoxia. Its pathophysiology is related to the lack of\nenergy because cellular respiration diminishes. This initially causes neurons\nto stop firing, and eventually in an arrest of cellular functions and cell\ndeath. Even sublethal HIE can set in motion a series of toxic reactions that\nkills injured neurons and even neurons that have not been damaged during the\ninitial insult. Thus, following global [ brain ischemia\n](http://www.columbianeurosurgery.org/conditions/cerebral-ischemia/) , neurons\ndo not die suddenly or all at once. In some of them, damage develops hours or\ndays after the insult. Most neurons undergo [ necrosis\n](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002266.htm) . In some\nneurons, HIE triggers [ apoptosis\n](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26873/) ( [ Neuropathology\n](http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html) ).\n\nSpecifically, energy depletion is believed to result in a failure of the [ Na\n\\+  ,K  \\+  ATPase\n](http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2010/Palmer/TheSodium-\nPotassiumPump.html) , leading to depolarization of the neuronal membrane (Fig.\n1). Synaptic function and conductivity cease at this point. Depolarization\ncauses neurons to release **glutamate** (Glu) into the synaptic cleft. Glu is\nthe most common excitatory neurotransmitter. In small amounts, it is\nindispensable for neuronal function. In excessive amounts, however, it is\nneurotoxic. Some Glu receptors, such as the NMDA and AMPA receptors, are non-\nselective cation-permeable ion channels. Initially, over-activation of these\nchannels causes a **passive influx** of Cl  \\-  (and Na  \\+  ) into cells\ncausing osmotic (cytotoxic) **edema** and **rapid death** ( [ Neuropathology\n](http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html) ).\n\nAdditional structural damage develops hours or even days later as a result of\nCa  2+  influx into neurons through NMDA and AMPA receptors (Fig. 1). This\ndelayed cell death is caused by an over-activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors\nby the excessive release of glutamate, which causes massive influx of Ca  2+\ninto neurons. Ca  2+  activates catabolic enzymes (proteases, phospholipases,\nendonucleases), and also NO synthase. NO is a free radical and other free\nradicals are generated due to the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation.\nFree radicals and activated catabolic enzymes destroy structural proteins,\nmembrane lipids, nucleic acids, and other cellular contents, causing neuronal\nnecrosis. DNA damage from endonucleases and mitochondrial injury from free\nradicals trigger apoptosis ( [ Neuropathology ](http://neuropathology-\nweb.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html) ).

It has\nbeen defined as:\n\n> Inhibition theory is based on the basic assumption that during the\n> performance of any mental task requiring a minimum of mental effort, the\n> subject actually goes through a series of alternating latent states of\n> distraction (non-work 0) and attention (work 1) which cannot be observed and\n> are completely imperceptible to the subject.\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation, see this paragraph from [ Wikipedia\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_attention_fatigue) :\n\n> Directed attention fatigue occurs when a particular part of the brain’s\n> global inhibitory system is overworked due to the suppression of increasing\n> numbers of stimuli. This temporary condition is not a clinical illness or a\n> personality disorder. It is rather a temporary fatigue of the inhibitory\n> mechanisms in the brain. According to inhibition theory, it is natural for\n> one to alternate between periods of attention and distraction. Although\n> one’s efforts may involve very different tasks, each incoming stimulus calls\n> upon the same directed attention mechanism.\n\nor this paragraph from [ NCBI ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926625) :\n\n> Recently, it has been shown that the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue\n> related to cognitive task performance are more complex than previously\n> thought and that mental fatigue is not caused only by impaired activity in\n> task-related brain regions. There is accumulating evidence supporting the\n> existence of mental facilitation and inhibition systems. These systems are\n> involved in the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue, modulating the activity\n> of task-related brain regions to regulate cognitive task performance.\n\nIn short, it is now believed that the brain contains mental facilitation and\ninhibition systems, which control mental freshness and fatigue. Basically,\nwhen you concentrate, you actually stop all distractions from taking over (and\nnot give more focus to the main point). This mechanism is governed by the\ninhibitory system of the brain. After some time, this system stops working\n('it gets tired') and you become unable to pay attention towards anything.\nThat's why it is advised that after some time of concentration, you need to\ndistract yourself (to refresh your inhibitory system); like, say, while\npreparing for exams, you should have a break of 5-10 minutes after studying\nfor about 45 minutes.\n\nNow, why mental tiredness causes physical fatigue can be (I think) summarized\nby the diagram below from [ here\n](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphys.2012.00082/full) :\n\n![Mechanism of physical fatigue from mental\nfatigue](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/21160/fphys-03-00082-HTML/image_m/fphys-03-00082-g001.jpg)\n\nThe exact process at this part is rather very interesting. Here, the neurons\n_are_ not firing as quickly as they do normally. See this [ Wikipedia\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_\\(medical\\)) page:\n\n> Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a\n> decrease of the efficiency of the neuro-muscular junction or by a reduction\n> of the drive originating from the central nervous system. The central\n> component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin\n> in the central nervous system. During motor activity, serotonin released in\n> synapses that contact motor neurons promotes muscle contraction. During high\n> level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a\n> spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the\n> axon initial segment of motor neurons with the result that nerve impulse\n> initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.\n\nThe same might happen in the case of mental fatigue i.e. the _excess_\nserotonin released from frontal or parietal lobes, or even the inhibition\nsystem itself, can cause the same effect i.e. inhibition of muscle\ncontraction.\n\n_References:_\n\n  1.

The reduction in hearing sensitivity is caused\nby the **loss of hair cells** . Hair cells are sensory cells in the inner ear\nthat convert acoustic vibrations into electrical signals. These signals are\ntransmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve.\n\nBecause of the **tonotopic organization** of the inner ear (the _cochlea_ )\none can conclude that presbyacusis develops from the basal to apical region.\nThe following schematic of the cochlea from [ Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n](https://www.britannica.com/science/inner-ear) nicely shows the cochlear\ntonotopy (i.e., high frequencies in the base, low frequencies in the apex);\n\n![cochlea](https://i.sstatic.net/ERAIB.jpg)\n\nAs to your question **why the basal region is more sensitive to aging** \\-\nthat is a very good and interesting question that has **not been answered, as\nfar as I am aware** . What is known, however, is that the basal regions of the\ncochlea are also more sensitive to the damaging effects of **ototoxic\nantibiotics** such as kanamycin ( [ Stronks _et al_ ., 2011\n](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCkQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FHuib_Versnel%2Fpublication%2F47660604_Effects_of_electrical_stimulation_on_the_acoustically_evoked_auditory-\nnerve_response_in_guinea_pigs_with_a_high-\nfrequency_hearing_loss%2Flinks%2F0c96053cd1c55581f2000000&ei=JYe8VJjTO-\nPPmwX_4oGQCA&usg=AFQjCNHO_pbdR5L3pW2btsnZGDdtEo-\niLA&sig2=S1nw5B9anvl__Iwy7eNgLA&bvm=bv.83829542,d.dGY) ) and other\naminoglycosides, and some **chemotherapeutics** such as cisplatin ( [ Schacht\n_et al_ ., 2012 ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596108/) ). In\nlow doses these compounds specifically target the basal regions over the\napical ones (at high doses the whole cochlea is affected).\n\nPerhaps the **specific anatomy and circulation** causes the basal region to be\naffected more by these chemicals. For example, blood flow may be enhanced\nbasally whereby environmental and food-based chemicals may enter the basal\nregion more readily (educated guesses, I can dig up references of authors\nposing these possibilities if necessary). This scenario may also contribute to\npresbyacusis, since it is quite imaginable that years of exposure to various\nsubstances may cause accumulation damage specifically to the basal parts of\nthe cochlea.\n\nIn addition, since high frequencies are coded in the basal region, and given\nthat sound enters the cochlea in the basal region (see picture below), **all\nsounds** , including damaging loud low-frequency stimuli **first travel to the\nbase** on their way to their point of processing.\n\n![Cochlea structure](https://i.sstatic.net/M9fxb.jpg)\n\nBecause sound is analyzed as a travelling wave, sound travel stops at that\npoint where the frequency matches the cochlear characteristic frequency. There\nthe wave quickly dies out due to cochlear filtering ( [ Mather, 2006\n](http://www.psypress.com/cw/mather-9781841696997/) ); see the first picture\nabove. In effect, more apical parts of the cochlea are exposed less frequently\nto (damaging) sound stimuli, while the **base of the cochlea is exposed to all\nsounds entering the inner ear** .\n\nHence, **chemical exposure and acoustic wear and tear** may be more prominent\nin the cochlear base, which can explain why **presbyacusis starts at the very\nhigh frequencies and progresses to low frequencies** (upward in the cochlea)\nfrom there.\n\n**References**  \n**-** [ Encyclopedia Brittanica* The-analysis-of-sound-frequencies-by-the-\nbasilar-membrane ](https://www.britannica.com/science/inner-ear)  \n**-** [ Kujawa & Liberman, _J Neurosci_ 2006; 26:2115-23\n](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/7/2115.full.pdf+html)  \n**-** [ Mather, Foundations of Perception, 2009\n](http://www.psypress.com/cw/mather-9781841696997/)  \n**-** [ Schacht et al, Anat Rec Hoboken 2013; 295:1837-50\n](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596108/)  \n**-** [ Stronks et al, Hear Res 2011; 272:95-107\n](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCkQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FHuib_Versnel%2Fpublication%2F47660604_Effects_of_electrical_stimulation_on_the_acoustically_evoked_auditory-\nnerve_response_in_guinea_pigs_with_a_high-\nfrequency_hearing_loss%2Flinks%2F0c96053cd1c55581f2000000&ei=JYe8VJjTO-\nPPmwX_4oGQCA&usg=AFQjCNHO_pbdR5L3pW2btsnZGDdtEo-\niLA&sig2=S1nw5B9anvl__Iwy7eNgLA&bvm=bv.83829542,d.dGY)"},

It is actually very difficult to do so because humans,\nobviously, are far more complex than some animal species which naturally show\nparthenogenesis. Just to mention, there are female-only animals also present\nin nature, such as [ New Mexico whiptail\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_whiptail) , which reproduce only by\nparthenogenesis, meaning that it is not as impractical as one might think.\n\nThere have been many parthenogenesis tests on mice and monkeys, but they\nusually result in abnormal development. This is because mammals have imprinted\ngenetic regions, where either the maternal or the paternal chromosome is\ninactivated in the offspring in order for development to proceed normally. A\nmammal created by parthenogenesis would have double doses of maternally\nimprinted genes and lack paternally imprinted genes, leading to developmental\nabnormalities. It has been suggested that defects in placental folding or\ninterdigitation are one cause of swine parthenote abortive development.\n\nDuring oocyte development, high metaphase promoting factor (MPF) activity\ncauses it to arrest at the metaphase II stage until a sperm fertilizes it. The\nfertilization event causes intracellular calcium oscillations, and targeted\ndegradation of cyclin B, a regulatory subunit of MPF, thus permitting the\noocyte to proceed through meiosis. The most precise and exact mechanism is not\nknown yet.\n\nBut this does not mean that it is not possible. Actually, it has been done\nquite a few times; [ once\n](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/clo.2007.0033) on June 26, 2007\nby International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCC), and [ once\n](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/03/hwang_parthenogenesis/)\n(controversially) on August 2, 2007 by Hwang Woo-Suk. Even the procedure for\nparthenogenesis (in swine though) in lab is available. To initiate\nparthenogenesis of swine oocytes, various methods exist to induce an\nartificial activation that mimics sperm entry, such as calcium ionophore\ntreatment, microinjection of calcium ions, or electrical stimulation.\nTreatment with cycloheximide, a non-specific protein synthesis inhibitor,\nenhances parthenote development in swine presumably by continual inhibition of\nMPF/cyclin B As meiosis proceeds, extrusion of the second polar is blocked by\nexposure to cytochalasin B. This treatment results in a diploid (2 maternal\ngenomes) parthenote Parthenotes can be surgically transferred to a recipient\noviduct for further development, but will succumb to developmental failure\nafter ≈30 days of gestation.\n\n[ ![swine parthenogenesis](https://i.sstatic.net/MIhux.jpg)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/MIhux.jpg)\n\nThe major problem with parthenogenesis in humans is the abnormal development\nof embryo. This has been accounted by a phenomenon known as genomic\nimprinting. Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon by which certain\ngenes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. For example, if the\nallele inherited from the father is imprinted, it is thereby silenced, and\nonly the allele from the mother is expressed. The death of diploid\nparthenogenetic or androgenetic mammalian embryos is determined by the absence\nof expression of the genes of imprinted loci of the maternal or paternal\ngenome, which leads to significant defects in development of tissues and\norgans. How this exactly works is not known yet, but it is supposed that it\nevolved to prevent parthenogenesis. Bi-parental reproduction is necessary due\nto parent-specific epigenetic modification of the genome during gametogenesis,\nwhich leads to non-equivalent expression of imprinted genes from the maternal\nand paternal alleles. Thus, genomic imprinting seems to be ineffective during\nnormal reproduction.\n\nAs a side note, in the article you refer to, the researchers did not just _mix\ntwo sperms and produce diploid zygote_ or something like that. In the\nprocedure, they injected a normal sperm to the above explained abnormal\nembryo, which later on proved to be viable. They, thus, showed that these kind\nof embryos can also become viable if they get fertilized by a sperm within\ntime.\n\n_**References:** _\n\n  * [ Abnormal development of embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages in parthenogenetic mouse embryos; Karin S.

Specifically, light exposure has been shown fear\nmediated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) [ (Grillon _et al_ ., 2007)\n](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322307005574) .\n\n[ ![!\\[!\\[HPA](https://i.sstatic.net/80z0p.jpg)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/80z0p.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

The HPA axis is activated by hypothalamic\nrelease of CRH, which stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone\n(ACH) from the anterior pituitary. ACH triggers the production of cortisol by\nthe adrenal glands. Cortisol, in turn, provides negative feedback and shuts\ndown HPA-axis activity by binding to corticosteroid receptors in various HPA-\naxis structures, e.g.the hypothalamus (Fig. 1). As a result, cortisol levels\nshow a robust diurnal rhythm that runs in opposite phase with CRH. Cortisol in\nhumans peaks at the time of awakening and drops to its lowest levels around\nbedtime, whereas the opposite is true for CRH [ (Miller & Gronfier, 2001)\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035930/) .\n\nThe **startle reflex shows a diurnal variation roughly opposite to the rhythm\nof corticosterone and in phase with CRH** . Specifically, **startle responses\nin nocturnal animals such as rats are highest during daytime** (their passive\nphase) when **CRH is peaking** , and corticosterone is at its lowest.\nConversely, startles are lowest during the night (their active phase) when CRH\nlevels are lowest, and corticosterone levels are high. **In man, a diurnal\nspecies, exactly the opposite pattern is observed** . Hence, s **tartle\nresponses are thought to be endogenously modulated by the circadian system** ,\nmost likely via effectors of the central pacemaker such as the **HPA-axis** [\n(Miller & Gronfier, 2001)\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035930/) .\n\nIn rats, **administration of exogenous CRH enhances the startle reflex** and\nblocking of the glucocorticoid receptors which produces a blockade of negative\nfeedback, also increases startles. Conversely, **blocking CRH receptors\ndecreases the startle response** , as does corticosterone administration [\n(Miller & Gronfier, 2001)\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035930/) .\n\nCRH receptors are expressed at various brain centers, including the **[\namygdala ](http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s4/chapter06.html) ** .

Seeing flashes of\nlight, stars and other shapes in the eyes occur when the body goes through\nstressful activities. For example while you are climbing the blood flow will\nbe more to other prominent parts like hands and lower waist so brain and eyes\nwill get less supply of blood as well as nutrients. Hence those flashes or\nstars are visible to us. This phenomena is called \"Phosphene\" and a phosphene\nis a phenomenon characterized by the experience of seeing light without light\nactually entering the eye.\n\n[ Wikipedia/Phosphene ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene) gives an\nexplanation for occurrence of Phosphenes:\n\n> Phosphene is \"seeing stars\", from a sneeze, laughter, a heavy and deep\n> cough, blowing of the nose, a blow on the head or low blood pressure (such\n> as on standing up too quickly or prior to fainting).

Now tilt your head to the side, and you will instantly\ngain a feeling which one is closer, and which one is further away. Why the\ndifference? Because any shift of a horizontal wire gives the same picture,\nmeanwhile for vertical wires the difference is obvious.\n\nWhen you close one eye, your brain loses the ability to estimate parallax.\nHowever, it is left with several options:\n\n  1. Visual cues. If one object overlaps another, it's obviously closer. If two objects look the same but one is smaller, it's probably further away (or a child).

After\n> establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus _Glomus\n> mosseae_ between tomato plants, inoculation of ‘donor’ plants with the\n> pathogen _Alternaria solani_ led to increases in disease resistance.\n\nThis other research demonstrate that the mycorrhizal network can be used to\nwarn neighbouring plants of aphid attacks (Babikova et al., 2013):\n\n> Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for\n> signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore\n> attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant\n> volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, _Vicia faba_\n> , repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids.\n> We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but\n> only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common\n> mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows\n> neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack.\n\nIn both cases the mycorrhizal networks play an important role in exchanging\nchemical substances among the plants.\n\nThe network has a _dark side_ too: it can be used to deliver allelochemicals\nfrom one plant to another, greatly increasing allelopathy. According to Barto\net al. (2011):\n\n> Common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) form belowground networks that\n> interconnect multiple plant species; yet these networks are typically\n> ignored in studies of allelopathy. We tested the hypothesis that CMNs\n> facilitate transport of allelochemicals from supplier to target plants,\n> thereby affecting allelopathic interactions.\n\nFinally: don't rely on media to get scientific information, specially in these\ntimes of _alternative facts_ . Sometimes you can get good information in the\nmedia, but good and accurate information is way harder to find (an example is\nthis [ BBC page ](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141111-plants-have-a-\nhidden-internet) about the mycorrhizal network).

It's generally used in simple pattern recognition situations\nwhere each case has no bearing on the next. The learning portion is performed\nahead of time during the training phase. For example, a [ deterministic\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) perceptron isn't\npermitted to change after training. In contrast, the [ Biological Neuron Model\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model) is much more complex,\nand uses a variety of [ ordinary differential equations\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) to integrate\nthe _cumulative_ behavior of neurons _over time_ . As such, those models are\nnon-deterministic and don't see as much practical use outside of\nexperimentation.\n\n**To address your second question** , neurons themselves don't \"learn.\" A\nsingle neuron is essentially meaningless. Learning is an emergent process\ncreated by the interaction of several systems at once. While one influencing\nfactor is connectivity (zero for no connection, non-zero for the inhibitory or\nexcitatory connection which emulates both [ synaptic\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity) and [ non-synaptic\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsynaptic_plasticity) ), what you might call\nshort term learning can also be performed by existing clusters of neurons,\nwithout any change in connectivity. Biologically, this is what must occur\n_before_ any of the comparably slow process of tissue remodelling can take\nplace, and the computationally equivalent process is only possible in time-\naware models like the aforementioned Biological Neuron Model.\n\nTake, for example, someone who wishes to learn to play guitar. When they begin\nplaying, existing clusters emulate the desired behavior as best as they can.\nThese neurons act as the functional scaffold that initiates and drives the\nneuroplastic process. Playing becomes _easier_ because this scaffold becomes\nmore efficient as new connections (shortcuts) are created, existing\nconnections are strengthened, and irrelevant connections are inhibited. The\nimproved scaffold in turn allows further improvements. [ Newborn neurons\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis) may also [ migrate\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblast) to the area, though the how, why,\nand when of that process is unclear to me. This \"behavior emulation\" or \"short\nterm learning\" process used in practicing the guitar, or whenever a novel\nsituation is encountered, must be primarily governed by excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons' influence. Otherwise the whole process cannot even begin.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n  * [ Parameter estimation of a spiking silicon neuron. ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852978)\n  * [ Synaptic plasticity, memory and the hippocampus: a neural network approach to causality ](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v9/n1/full/nrn2303.html)\n  * [ Signaling mechanisms in cortical axon growth, guidance, and branching ](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnana.2011.00062/abstract)"},

Many vegetables taste bitter because they contain compounds\nknown as phytonutrients ( _Greek_ phyto = \"plant\"). There are more than 2500\nphytonutrients known, and the most important (and common) ones are categorized\nas  [ 1 ](http://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/phytonutrients-faq#1) :\n\n  * **Carotenoids:** they are the ones that give red/orange/yellow color to some vegetables. They are mainly antioxidants, but some of them, like $\\beta$-carotene and $\\beta$-cryptoxanthin, are good for eyes as they can be converted into vitamin-A, whose derivative forms a part of [ phototransduction cascade ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_phototransduction) . \n\n  * **Ellagic acid:** it is found in a number of berries, such as strawberries, raspberries, pomegranates, etc. and has been shown _in vitro_ to be helpful in slowing the growth of cancer cells and aid liver in neutralizing cancer-causing chemicals. \n\n  * **Flavonoids:** they are found in a large variety of plants and constitute a large number of phytonutrients. Some flavonoids, like catechins, hesperidin and quercetin are very good for health. For example, see [ this ](https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/56980/19099) answer for effects of catechins on the body. \n\n  * **Resveratrol:** it is found in grapes, red wine, etc. and shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Some researches have also concluded that it may reduce risk of heart disease and certain cancers. \n\n  * **Glucosinolates:** these are found in cruciferous vegetables, like sprouts, cabbage, etc. and help checking formation and growth of cancer. This is the one we're talking about, so I'll continue about this below. \n\n  * **Phytoestrogens:** they can exert estrogen-like effects on the body because of their structure, and even block body's natural supply of estrogen. Isoflavones can also reduce risk of endometrial cancer and bone loss in women. They are also found in a large number of plants, including soybeans, oats, barley, rice, apples, carrots, etc. (see full list [ here ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogens#Food_sources) ). \n\nAnother category, alkaloids, has been discussed by @WYSIWYG in their [ answer\n](https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/57046/19099) . These are all made\nnaturally by plants as a part of their defense mechanism against insects and\npests. This, in part, explains why they are bitter.\n\nComing to main point, glucosinolates are organic compounds that are\nresponsible for bitter taste and pungent smell of many cruciferous vegetables.\nThey are derived from glucose and amino acid, and contain sulfur and nitrogen\nas constituents. When they are cooked, chewed, or otherwise damaged, an enzyme\n[ myrosinase ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrosinase) cleaves the glucose\nmolecule, while the remaining molecule converts into isothiocyanate,\nthiocyanate and nitrile  [ 2 ](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11103-006-9071-5)\n, which cause the bitter taste and pungent smell (think of the isocyanide test\nyou performed in grade XI and the smell it produced ;) The reaction looks like\nthis:\n\n[ ![myrosinase action on glucosinolate](https://i.sstatic.net/54YhV.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/54YhV.png) [ source\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucosinolate)\n\nA special glucosinolate, sinigrin, has been shown as responsible for the\nbitterness of Brussels sprouts and cauliflower  [ 3\n](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2F%28SICI%291097-0010%28199809%2978%3A1%3C30%3A%3AAID-\nJSFA79%3E3.0.CO%3B2-N) . Also, high concentration of glucosinolates are toxic\nto humans as well as other animals, though tolerance levels vary even within\nthe same genera ( _Acomys cahirinus_ and _Acomys russatus_ )  [ 4\n](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10682-013-9655-x) . So, that partly explains\nwhy these compounds are bitter.\n\nTalking about the anti-cancer properties of glucosinolates (going a bit off-\ntopic just so that you know why these are good for you), two of the main\ncompounds that are responsible for such effects are sulforaphane and\nindole-3-carbinol. [ Sulforaphane\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulforaphane) (in which R- becomes C  5  H  11\nOS- in R-NCS), for example, is derived by the action of myrosinase on\nglucoraphanin (again, a glucosinolate). It has been shown to have anti-cancer\nproperties. For example, [ Li _et al_ , 2010\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862133/) have shown that\nsulforaphane prevents breast cancer by inhibiting breast cancer stem cells and\ndownregulating the Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin pathway (yeah, there is something like\ncancer stem cell!). In another research, [ Hsu _et al_ , 2011\n](https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1868-7083-3-3)\nshowed that sulforaphane prevents prostate cancer by inhibiting HDACs (histone\ndeacetylases, which interfere with normal functioning of tumor suppressor\ngenes) and DNA methylation. This example was just to mention about the anti-\ncancer properties of glucosinolates in general.\n\nAnother class of compounds, called cucurbitacins, are produced in plants of\nCucurbitaceae family. Unlike phytonutrients, cucurbitacins are considered a\ntype of steroid since they are derived from cucurbitane and stored as\nglycosides  [ 5 ](https://dx.doi.org/10.1039%2FB418841C) . Their derivatives\nare also found in other families like Rubiaceae, Rosaceae and even some marine\nmollusks, and, much like glucosinolates, they are also produced for defense\nagainst herbivores.\n\nHowever, it is not sure whether only glucosinolates are the only compounds\nresponsible for bitterness of vegetables. A study suggests that increased\nlevels of calcium can also be responsible for bitterness of vegetables  [ 6\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768385/) , although its\nevolutionary cause and mechanism of action are unknown yet. Also, it may even\ndepend on the person(!). If you are a supertaster (which has high chances to\nbe true if you're woman or from Asia, South America or Africa), you will tend\nto be highly sensitive to bitterness of _Brassica oleracca_ cultivars, such as\nkale, Brussels sprouts or cabbage  [ 7\n](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.physbeh.2005.10.018) , [ 8\n](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2FS1368980099000695) . Sensitivity to coffee,\ngreen tea, mushrooms, etc. is also known to increase. You can view a full list\non [ Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster) .\n\n**References:**\n\n1\\.

The eye regulates the\namount of entering light by contracting or expanding the pupil. At night, your\npupils will accordingly enlarge to extract more light from their surroundings.\nHowever, this dilation also leaves your eyes unprepared for the sudden burst\nof light from a camera flash.\n\nWhen light from the flash enters your eyes under these conditions, **your\npupils are unable to contract fast enough** (full constriction takes a few\nseconds) to prevent the **light from reflecting back** , off of the red blood\nvessels **of the _choroid_ ** . The choroid plexus nourishes the retina, and\ntherefore contains ample blood supply. As a result, the camera will pick up\nthe red reflection, resulting in the red-eye effect. Interestingly, due to\ntheir increased “dark adaptation,” children more commonly have red eyes in\nphotographs.\n\nThe amount of melanin, a light-absorbing pigment in the eye, also has a role\nin the red-eye effect. Individuals with **lower levels of melanin** will\nabsorb less and thus **reflect more light** , explaining the high incidence of\nthe red-eye effect in albinos.\n\nThough the cause of this effect is wired in the biology of the eye, some\ncameras can reduce red-eye by sending a few preliminary flashes before the\nfinal flash to give the **pupils enough time to contract** and adapt to the\nincreased-light conditions. Another way to reduce the effect is to avoid\nlooking directly into the camera lens, which will reduce the reflection of\nlight. Finally, if all else fails, modern image editing software, such as\nPhotoshop, can remove the red discoloration.\n\nWith regard to why dogs and other animals may not have red-eyes but other\ncolors, this was indeed answered in your [ linked question\n](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27621/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-\ngreen-on-a-photo) : some animal species have a **_tapetum lucidum_ , which is\nsituated in front of the choroid and reflects light back ** onto the retina\nthereby increasing light sensitivity.

To control metabolism, we need to control our\napetite, and to control our apetite, we need to suppress our hunger. _So...?_\nWhen you wake up, you still have a hangover of this effect. In other words, it\ntakes some time to change the secretion rates of leptin and ghrelin and the\nresulting effects.\n\nLets get into some analytical details now. According to [ Sharma _et al_ ,\n2010 ](https://doi.org/10.1155%2F2010%2F270832) , metabolic rate and brain\ntemperature are lowered during non-REM sleep to deal with the damages that may\nhave occured during time of wakefulness. In their study, the subjects were\ndeprived of sleep for 2 nights (4 hours per night) and then allowed to sleep\nfor next 2 nights (10 hours per night). The result? Leptin levels decreased by\n18% and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. The subjects also craved for more\ncarbs. Also, craving for salty foods increased by 45%. Overall hunger\nincreased by 23% due to reduction in leptin levels. They also showed that\npeople who sleep less than 5 hours have increased Body Mass Index (BMI). All\nthis points to the fact that sleep does cause reduction in apetite and hunger.\nIn short, don't think of missing your breakfast.\n\n**References:**\n\n  * [ Sharma, Sunil; Kavuru, Mani (2 August 2010). \"Sleep and Metabolism: Overview\". _International Journal of Endocrinology._ **2010** : 1–12. doi:10.1155/2010/270832. ](https://doi.org/10.1155%2F2010%2F270832)\n\n  * [ Wikipedia contributors. \"Sleep and metabolism.\" _Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia._ Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 8 Feb. 2017.

Insects which have adopted this method are far more diverse than their\n[ hemimetabolous ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemimetabolism) counterparts.\nA conservative estimate by Hammond (1992) is that holometabolous insects\ncomprise more than 60% of all living organisms.\n\nThe subclass [ Pterygota ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygota) (winged\ninsects) is divided into (super orders) [ endopterygota\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endopterygota) (wings develop interiorly) which\nare holometabolous, and the [ exopterygota\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exopterygota) (external wing development) which\nare hemimetabolous.\n\nHemimetabolous insects (usually) develop from an egg to an adult through a\nseries of immature forms (known as nymphs or instars) which are slightly\nmodified (and usually slightly larger) forms of the preceding form. There are\nexceptions to this mode within the exopterygota including asexual\nparthenogenesis which is common in aphids. The general life cycle is well\nillustrated in the Dermaptera (earwigs). All stages inhabit the same\necological niche and so maintain the same general body plan.\n\n![Dermaptera lifecycle, from Wikimedia\ncommons](https://i.sstatic.net/K8LHR.png)\n\nImage file from Wikimedia Commons [ here\n](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earwig_life_cycle_2.svg)\n\nAlthough hemimetaboly is a more gradual process than holometaboly, it happens\nin a small number (often four or five nymphal instars) of discrete steps\nrather than the more continuous development of other animals such as mammals.\nAlthough all insects fall into either the exopterygote or endopterygote\ncategories (i.e. wings either develop externally or internally), there are\nexamples of intermediate processes which lie somewhere between hemi- and\nholometaboly. A notable example are the Cicadas. Cicadas are Hemiperans (true\nbugs) which lie in the exopterygota and so are, by default hemimetabolous.\nHowever there is a considerable difference between their immature and mature\nstages:\n\n![Cicada \\(Auchenorrhyncha: Hemiptera\\)\ndevelopment](https://i.sstatic.net/HK9tn.jpg)\n\nIllustration by Debbie Hadley, using drawings from Insects - Their Ways and\nMeans of Living by Robert Evans Snodgrass, U.S. Bureau of Entomology. These\ndrawings are in the public domain. From [ here\n](http://insects.about.com/od/growthmetamorphosi1/ss/typesmetamorph_3.htm) .\n\nDuring the immature stages, the larva (or nymph) will burrow underground,\nsometimes for many years. This requires strong front appendages, which they\nalso use when they surface to grip onto a surface whilst they shed their final\nskin to become an adult. This differential niche exploitation is likely to\nhave given rise to the morphological differences between immature and mature\nlife stages.\n\nExploiting different niches during different developmental stages not only\nreduces intra-specific competition between young and adult, it also enables\nthe insect to be more specialised to fulfill their specific role, which\nchanges as they develop. The role of the immature is to grow, they do not yet\nneed to be able to reproduce or disperse; whereas the role of the adult is to\nfind a mate and reproduce. Young often develop below ground where there are\nfewer predators, adults often fly to enhance dispersal (further reducing\ncompetition and also decreasing inbreeding). These two activities call for\nvastly different body designs.\n\nSome other common holometabolous insect orders are Coleoptera (beetles),\nHymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), and Diptera (true flies), whereas\nhemimetabolous groups include Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets etc.),\nMantodea (praying mantids), and Blattaria (cockroaches).\n\nAs for the chrysalis which Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) have evolved to\nsurround their pupal stage, the main role is likely to be protection. Larvae\n(caterpillars) are a highly nutritious and energetic food source and thus have\nadapted defensive mechanisms such as mimicry, warning colours, and dropping to\nthe ground when disturbed. This drop would damage the metamorphosing pupa (the\nmost vulnerable stage as it is usually relatively immobile), as the cuticle\nsoftens to allow for cell-rearrangement.\n\nThe process of insect development is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH), see [\nKonopova\n](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0028728#pone.0028728-Kristensen1)\n_et al_ , (2011) for more on this.\n\n**References**\n\n  * Hammond, P.

Since the nerves for ring finger and\nlittle finger are intertwined, it becomes difficult to move each of these\nfingers separately. Similarly, you may find it easier to move your ring finger\nalong with your middle finger. But you can easily move your middle finger\nindependently because it gets signals from radial as well as ulnar nerves.\n\nThus, it is the combined effect of muscular and neural anatomy of ring finger\nwhich causes this effect.\n\n_PS:_ Since the effect is due to the neural and muscular anatomy of the ring\nfinger, I don't think surgery would help in this case.\n\n**References:**\n\n  * [ Wikipedia contributors. \"Extrinsic extensor muscles of the hand.\" _Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia._ Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 29 Jan. 2017.

This implies that\nany change in this number is promptly selected against. It is generally agreed\nthat **insects were derived from many-legged ancestors** , e.g. centipedes.\n\nOne explanation is the **tripod gait** that results from having six\nappendages. This hypothesis, formulated more than 6 decades ago [ (Lanham,\n1951) ](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf) , reasons\nthat a reduction of the number of legs during evolution did not go further\nthan 6, because locomotion of a small animal encased in a rigid exoskeleton is\nnot effective with less than 3 pairs of legs. Insects generally walk by\nlifting the two outer legs on one side and the middle on the other side,\nsweeping them forward and placing them down together. Hence, insects **support\ntheir rigid structures with a tripod** at all times. **Tripods are** among the\nmost **stable** configurations, and they never wobble (why on earth do tables\nhave 4 legs?).

Insects' locomotion resembles a double tripod. Insects have a cyclic\ngait which consists of two phases, the stance phase and the swing phase. The\nstance phase is the power stroke, it pushes the body forwards in the direction\nof travel while the leg remains on the ground. Three legs are used is this\nphase by forming a tripod with the front leg and the hind leg on one side of\nthe body and the middle leg on the other side. This formation is why this gait\nis known as the tripod gait. Source: [ Insect robotics ](http://robotic-\ninsects.weebly.com/) .\n\nLarger animals can afford to have less legs, because their vestibular systems\nhave more time to maintain balance and adjust gait during locomotion. Because\ninsects are so small, their strides are so quick that the nervous system may\nnot be fast enough to deal with gait control. Instead, insects rely on the\ntripod gait to prevent any imbalance, rather than adjusting it. In addition,\nthe exoskeleton effectively restricts small bodily movements to control\nbalance. Larger animals such as mammals make small adjustments in their gait\nconstantly to maintain balance. An insect has less opportunities to do so,\nbecause of their rigid exoskeleton [ (Lanham, 1951)\n](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf) .\n\n**Reference**  \n**-** [ Lanham, _Science_ (1951); **113** (2946): 663\n](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf)"},

Determining the focus of a visual image is carried out\nin the [ visual association area\n](http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter07.html) of the brain. Ultimately,\nthis process results in focusing of the retinal image by adjustment of the\nshape of the lens in the eye. Lens shaping to focus the image is called\n**accommodation**\n\nThe neuronal circuitry involved in accommodation includes the following\nstructures:\n\nThe input to the accommodation response is provided by the retina, optic\nnerve, thalamus, and visual cortex. The visual cortex projects to the\nassociation cortex.\n\nThe (simplified) output scheme is the following: The association cortex\nprojects to the supraoculomotor nuclei, which in turn generates motor control\nsignals that initiate the accommodation response. The signal is then sent\nbilaterally to the oculomotor complex, and hence input from one eye is enough\nto focus both eyes.\n\nThe motor output regulates the ciliary muscles that control the shape of the\ncrystalline lens. Negative accommodation adjusts the eye for long distances by\nrelaxation of the ciliary muscles. Positive accommodation adjustment of the\neye for short distances by contraction of the ciliary muscles [ Medical\nDictionary ](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/accommodation) .\n\nAs to the second part of your question: how out-of-focus images are\nfunctionally recognized:\n\nThere are at least three mechanisms responsible for accommodation:\n\n1) Detection of **image blur** : if an image is blurred / out of focus the\nedges are not clearly defined. Retinal blur can be detected (edge detection)\nand assessed in the brain. Correction is then initiated as described above,\nand is basically done by trial and error. If adjustment results in a change of\nblur, the accommodation response (lens deformation) is detected as useful and\naccommodation is initiated. The accommodation itself is also based on trial-\nand-error: if blur increases the accommodation is reversed, if it decreases\naccommodation is increased in the same direction. ( [ Philips & Stark, 1977\n](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01569293) ). Image blur operates\nmonocularly and is sufficient for accommodation to occur and is likely the\nmost important mechanism for accommodation. It can occur without prior\nknowledge of distance, size etc.\n\nTwo more specific cases also result in accommodation, with likely similar\nneural circuitry involved:\n\n2) **Vergence / retinal disparity** . This stimulus is generated when the eyes\nmove both in opposite directions, i.e. when focus shifts toward objects closer\nor farther away. The temporary displacement on binocular retinal images is\ndetected and leads to initiation of accommodation [ Fincham & Walton, 1977\n](http://jp.physoc.org/content/137/3/488.full.pdf) .\n\n3). The **near response** : While 1) and 2) are retinotopic responses, the\nnear-response is initiated by spatiotopic stimuli, including perceived depth\nand distance of objects, which are derived from cues such as relative size,\noverlap, perspective, shading and texture gradients as well as small\ntimevarying dynamic depth cues which include motion parallax, loom and motion\nin depth. Dynamic cues provide time-varying references for perception of\nrelative depth whereas static cues allow simultaneous comparison of separate\nabsolute distances from which relative depth is perceived ( [ Schor et al.,\n1991\n](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F1454368&ei=ZQODVKXKKcrf8AXL14HoDQ&usg=AFQjCNFhgMm1PGqccg-\ntGT9lvCxOxHc7bw&sig2=5xzOa3FSHTgVd_RJ49pPsQ&bvm=bv.80642063,d.dGc) )."},

This is accomplished by negative feedback\nsystems incorporating pressure sensors (i.e., baroreceptors) that sense the\narterial pressure. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in\nthe carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of external and internal carotids) and\nin the aortic arch (Figure 1). These receptors respond to stretching of the\narterial wall so that if arterial pressure suddenly rises, the walls of these\nvessels passively expand, which increases the firing frequency of receptor\naction potentials. If arterial blood pressure suddenly falls, decreased\nstretch of the arterial walls leads to a decrease in receptor firing.\n\nThe carotid sinus baroreceptors are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering,\nwhich is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX cranial nerve). The\nglossopharyngeal nerve synapses in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)\nlocated in the medulla of the brainstem. The aortic arch baroreceptors are\ninnervated by the aortic nerve, which then combines with the vagus nerve (X\ncranial nerve) traveling to the NTS. The NTS modulates the activity of\nsympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) neurons in the medulla, which in turn\nregulate the autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/Pp9V6.png)\n\nOf these two sites for arterial baroreceptors, the carotid sinus is\nquantitatively the most important for regulating arterial pressure. The\ncarotid sinus receptors respond to pressures ranging from 60-180 mmHg (Figure\n2). Receptors within the aortic arch have a higher threshold pressure and are\nless sensitive than the carotid sinus receptors. Maximal carotid sinus\nsensitivity occurs near the normal mean arterial pressure; therefore, very\nsmall changes in arterial pressure around this \"set point\" dramatically alters\nreceptor firing so that autonomic control can be reset in such a way that the\narterial pressure remains very near to the set point. This set point changes\nduring exercise, hypertension, and heart failure. The changing set point\n(response curve shifts to right) explains how arterial pressure can remain\nelevated during chronic hypertension.\n\nBaroreceptors are sensitive to the rate of pressure change as well as to the\nsteady or mean pressure. Therefore, at a given mean arterial pressure,\ndecreasing the pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic pressure) decreases\nthe baroreceptor firing rate. This is important during conditions such as\nhemorrhagic shock in which pulse pressure as well as mean pressure decreases.\nThe combination of reduced mean pressure and reduced pulse pressure amplifies\nthe baroreceptor response.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/1Kza8.png)\n\nAlthough the baroreceptors can respond to either an increase or decrease in\nsystemic arterial pressure, their most important role is responding to sudden\nreductions in arterial pressure (Figure 3). This can occur, for example, when\na person suddenly stands up or following blood loss (hemorrhage). A decrease\nin arterial pressure (mean, pulse or both) results in decreased baroreceptor\nfiring. Autonomic neurons within the medulla respond by increasing sympathetic\noutflow and decreasing parasympathetic (vagal) outflow. Under normal\nphysiological conditions, baroreceptor firing exerts a tonic inhibitory\ninfluence on sympathetic outflow from the medulla. Therefore, acute\nhypotension results in a disinhibition of sympathetic activity within the\nmedulla, so that sympathetic activity originating within the rostral\nventrolateral medulla increases. These autonomic changes cause\nvasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance, SVR), tachycardia\nand positive inotropy. The latter two changes increase cardiac output.\nIncreases in cardiac output and SVR lead to a partial restoration of arterial\npressure.\n\n**It is important to note that baroreceptors adapt to sustained changes in\narterial pressure. For example, if arterial pressure suddenly falls when a\nperson stands, the baroreceptor firing rate will decrease; however, after a\nperiod of time, the firing returns to near normal levels as the receptors\nadapt to the lower pressure. Therefore, the long-term regulation of arterial\npressure requires activation of other mechanisms (primarily hormonal and\nrenal) to maintain normal blood pressure.**\n\nThis information from **PhD Richard E.

  {"query": " Explain the process called osmosis, where yeast cells absorb water from their surroundings, causing the solid yeast granules to dissolve and become a watery solution capable of dissolving other substances like sugar.", "reasoning": "We can look into how certain substances naturally draw water from their surroundings, a process that helps explain the transformation of yeast and sugar from solids to a liquid state.", "id": "102", "excluded_ids": ["N/A"], "gold_ids_long": ["yeast_dissolve_in_sugar/Osmosis.txt"], "gold_ids": ["yeast_dissolve_in_sugar/Osmosis_0.txt"], "gold_answer": "$\\begingroup$\n\nThe whole process is called [ osmosis ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis)\n. In it there is the flow of liquid along a concentration gradient. Water then\nflows from the side which contains the low concentration of dissolved\nmolecules (this can be salts or sugar for example) to the side with the higher\nconcentration until it reached equilibrium. This principle is shown in the\nimage below (all images from the Wikipeadia article on [ osmosis\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis) ):\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/S9abq.jpg)\n\nThe blue dots are the dissolved material, the concentration is high on the\nright side and lower on the left. Through the dotted line in the middle (which\nis a semi-permeable membrane) only the solvent can pass to reach a\nconcentration equilibrium. There is a pretty cool osmotic pressure simulator\navailable on [ Molecular Logic\n](http://molo.concord.org/database/activities/72.html) which can also help\nunderstanding the principle.\n\nAnd this is exactly what happens to the yeast cells. The sugar crystalls get\ndissolved (at least partly) by some of the humidity from the yeast block (this\nwill not work with dried yeast) and form a highly concentrated sugar solution\n(also called hypertonic). The sugar concentration inside the cells is\nrelatively low (called hypotonic). This leads to the effort to balance the\nconcentration inside the cell and outside of it which then leads to a massive\nefflux of water from the cells. This goes so far, that the cell membranes\nbreak and the interior of the cells is released (nucleus, DNA, proteins and so\non) and the sugar is completely dissolved in the released water. The reason\nwhy this mixture is so \"gooey\" afterwards is the DNA, which forms long, thick\nstrains.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/gv3Y7.png)\n\nThis method can be used in the lab to break up cells relatively gently without\napplying too much force.\n\nWhen baking you should make sure, that your yeast is not coming directly into\ncontact with undissolved sugar (or salt which works the same way), as this\nwill kill a part of your yeast cells. However, for baking you usually dissolve\nthe yeast in water or milk, so there is a huge excess of water which dissolves\nthe sugar (or salt) and protects the cells. Addionally your yeast is much\nbetter distributed in the dough and gives better results."}
