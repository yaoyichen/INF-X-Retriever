The text not only defines the IVT but also explains how it applies to continuous functions over a real interval, ensuring there exists a point where the function equals a given value between its values at two endpoints of the interval. This reasoning is analogous to the solution's approach of finding a point where cos(x) equals x^2023, indicating that the text can help a student understand how the IVT is applied to solve the problem.

This explanation is closely related to the use of the IVT in the solution, where the theorem is applied to show that because the cosine function and x^k function have different values at the endpoints of an interval but must pass through all values between due to continuity, there must exist a point where cos(x) = x^k for k = 2023 within the interval.\n\nThe text is helpful for understanding and solving the given problem because it aligns with the reasoning steps used in the solution: identifying a continuous function's behavior over an interval and utilizing the IVT to prove the existence of a solution within that interval. The solution applies the IVT to demonstrate that there exists at least one value of x within the interval (0, 1) where cos(x) = x^2023.

This formulation of the IVT, although presented in a more abstract setting, fundamentally aligns with the same principles used in the solution to the problem statement. The problem solution relies on the IVT by arguing that since the cosine function and the polynomial function \\(x^{2023}\\) are continuous and take on values at different ends of an interval with a transition in between, there must exist a point within that interval where the two functions are equal. This reasoning directly parallels the abstract scenario described in the text, where it's stated that for any value between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), there exists some \\(c\\) such that \\(f(c) = r\\).

It outlines a specific case where the function changes sign over an interval, which implies the existence of at least one root within that interval according to the IVT. Similarly, the solution to the given problem uses the IVT to argue that because the functions cos(x) and \\(x^{2023}\\) have different behaviors over a specific interval and due to the properties of these functions within the interval \\([-1, 1]\\), there must be at least one point where \\(cos(x) = x^{2023}\\). \n\nBoth the text and the solution rely on the fundamental concept of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which asserts the existence of a root within an interval where a continuous function undergoes a sign change or meets a specific value between its endpoints.

While the problem statement and the solution focus on linear independence in the context of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) (a more concrete setting), the text abstracts the concept to a broader context involving functions within any vector space. Despite these differences in context, the underlying principle is the same: checking if only the trivial solution exists to a particular equation (whether it's \\(\\sum c_i v_i = 0\\) or \\(\\sum c_i f_i(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\)) to determine linear independence. \n\nBoth the solution's approach to the problem and the text's theorem apply the concept of linear independence by examining if a system of equations only has the trivial solution. In the problem's case, it's through the coefficients of vectors equaling zero; in the text's case, it's through the coefficients of functions leading to a zero vector after applying them in a matrix equation.

It explains that if a set of elements (in this case, the elements of a Schauder basis) in a vector space can only sum to the zero vector when all coefficients in their linear combination are zero, then the set is linearly independent. This aligns with the theorem definition provided, which states that a set of vectors is linearly independent if the only solution to their linear combination equating to the zero vector is when all coefficients are zero. \n\nThe problem statement asks whether a given set of vectors are linearly independent. The solution involves setting up an equation for a linear combination of the given vectors to equal the zero vector and solving for the coefficients, which is conceptually parallel to the explanation in the text regarding the Schauder basis. The solution process directly applies the definition of linear independence, examining if the only solution for the coefficients is the trivial one (all coefficients being zero), which mirrors the reasoning provided in the text about how to establish linear independence.\n\nGiven that the text explains a process for determining linear independence that is directly applicable to solving the problem (even though the context of Schauder bases might be more specific), it can indeed be helpful to a student trying to understand and solve the problem regarding the linear independence of a set of vectors.

This directly relates to the concept of linear independence by explaining that if you have more vectors than dimensions, at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, meaning the vectors are linearly dependent.\n\nThe text is helpful in understanding the problem and arriving at a solution because it provides a theoretical foundation for why, in a system with more vectors than the dimension of the vector space they occupy, those vectors cannot all be linearly independent. This reasoning is closely aligned with the solution's application of the concept of linear independence to solve the problem. Thus, the text could assist a student in understanding why the given vectors v_1, v_2, and v_3, which span a 3-dimensional space, cannot all be linearly independent if treated as a system with more vectors than dimensions (since the vectors are part of a 3-dimensional space but follow a pattern that suggests they are not all independent).\n\nAnswer: True", "id": "TheoremQA_elainewan/math_algebra_3_2.json", "excluded_ids": [], "gold_ids_long": ["N/A"], "gold_ids": ["20819", "20859", "12693"], "gold_answer": "N/A"},

This piece of information reinforces the understanding of acyclic graphs (the foundation for the theorem used in the solution) by highlighting a specific property—namely, the absence of cycles, which is a critical aspect of why distributions over directed trees can be equivalently represented over undirected trees without loss of structure or information.

The problem statement is about transforming a distribution represented by a directed tree (a form of directed acyclic graph or DAG) into an equivalent distribution over the corresponding undirected tree. Understanding the nature of acyclic graphs, as described in the text, is fundamental to grasping why such a transformation is possible. Since trees are a subset of acyclic graphs, knowing that an acyclic connected undirected graph is a tree helps in understanding the transition from a directed to an undirected form without introducing cycles, thus maintaining the acyclic property.

This relationship is significant because the solution to the problem utilizes the Stirling number of the second kind, S(10, 3), to find the number of ways to create such partitions. Although the text primarily focuses on Bell numbers, the underlying concept of using Stirling numbers of the second kind as a building block is crucial for understanding how partitions of a set into non-empty subsets are counted, which is exactly what is needed to solve the problem.

The solution to this problem utilizes the derivative of the function and checks for the sign change in the derivative values at the endpoints of the given interval. The Intermediate Value Theorem is implicitly used in the reasoning that if the derivative changes sign (from negative to positive or vice versa) across an interval, then it must cross zero at least once within that interval.\n\nHowever, the theorem provided and the text to be evaluated both explicitly discuss Rolle's Theorem, which is a specific application of the Intermediate Value Theorem but under the condition that \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) for a function continuous on \\([a, b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a, b)\\).

This is closely related to the problem solution, which involves finding a point where the derivative of a given function equals zero, using the derivative's properties and the concept of change in function values over an interval.

In the solution provided, a t-statistic is calculated and used to test the hypothesis regarding the mean difference between two types of rubber plants. Thus, the text introduces a fundamental concept (test statistic) that is directly applied in the t-test procedure described in the solution. Therefore, it can assist a student in understanding the underlying principles of how the solution applies the t-test to solve the problem.

The Binomial Theorem is specifically mentioned in the problem's solution to calculate the number of ways to select 3 students from a class of 20, using the combination formula derived from binomial coefficients. The Multinomial Theorem, as described in the text, extends the concept of binomial coefficients to multinomial coefficients for more than two terms. While the Multinomial Theorem itself is not directly used in the problem's solution, the foundational concept of binomial coefficients that is integral to understanding and applying the combination formula (C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) is closely related to the content of the text. The text could help a student not familiar with the theorem by grounding the understanding of binomial coefficients in a broader mathematical context, thereby potentially aiding in understanding the specific application of these coefficients in solving the problem.

This fundamental relationship is mathematically expressed and solved in the examples given in the text.\n\nIn the problem statement, the student is asked to use Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law to determine the orbital period of Mercury around the Sun. The solution applies this law by considering the gravitational constant, the masses of the Sun and Mercury, and the mean orbital radius of Mercury. Even though the solution specifically employs Newton's version, which incorporates the gravitational constant and the masses of the celestial bodies, the underlying principle of the square of the orbital period being proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (or mean orbital radius in this case) is a direct application of Kepler's Third Law.

This theorem is precisely the one utilized in the solution to the given problem, which aims to determine if the polynomial $p(x) = x^5 + x - 1$ has any real roots. The solution applies the IVT by evaluating the polynomial at two points and using the change in sign to infer the existence of a root between those points, which aligns with the core concept of the IVT as explained in the text. The text's explanation includes the necessary conditions for applying the IVT, namely the continuity of the function on an interval and the presence of values of opposite signs at two points within the interval. This information can assist a student in understanding why the IVT is applicable to the problem and how it leads to the conclusion that there is at least one real root. Therefore, the text can be helpful for a student not familiar with the theorem in understanding and solving the given problem.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Intermediate Value Theorem/Corollary: The given text presents a corollary of the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) that specifically focuses on the existence of a root (where the function equals zero) in an open interval, given that the function takes on values with opposite signs at the endpoints of the interval. This is precisely the concept used in the solution to the problem, where the solution applies the IVT to show that the polynomial $p(x) = x^5 + x - 1$ must have a real root between $x = -1$ and $x = 1$ because $p(-1) < 0$ and $p(1) > 0$. The text and the solution both rely on the fundamental idea of the IVT—that a continuous function which takes values of opposite signs at two points in an interval must cross zero at least once within that interval. Therefore, the text can be considered helpful for a student trying to understand how to apply the IVT to prove the existence of a real root in a given interval for a continuous function.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Intermediate Value Theorem (Topology): The given text presents a more general form of the Intermediate Value Theorem within the context of topology, specifically focusing on connected topological spaces and continuous mappings. It outlines that if a continuous function maps from a connected space to a totally ordered set, and if this function takes two values such that one is strictly less than the other, then for any value between these two, there exists a preimage in the original space. This reasoning aligns closely with the application of the Intermediate Value Theorem in the solution to the problem statement, which involves determining the existence of a real root for a polynomial by evaluating the function at two points and using the fact that the function values at these points have opposite signs. The topological version of the theorem provided in the text emphasizes the same core principle that the solution employs: if a function is continuous and takes on values on either side of a given value, there must be a point where the function equals that given value. This principle is applied in the problem solution to show that the polynomial must have a real root between two points where the function values have opposite signs. Therefore, despite the more abstract setting, the text can be helpful in understanding and solving the given problem by applying the Intermediate Value Theorem in a closely related way.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Existence of Positive Root of Positive Real Number/Positive Exponent: The given text discusses a theorem related to the existence of a positive root for a given positive real number with a positive exponent. It essentially says that for any positive real number x and any positive integer n, there exists a non-negative real number y such that y raised to the power of n equals x. This discussion involves using the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to prove that a function defined by raising y to the power of n can achieve any positive value x, given that the function starts at a value less than or equal to x and is unbounded above.\n\nThe problem statement, on the other hand, is about determining whether a specific polynomial has any real roots. The solution applies the Intermediate Value Theorem by evaluating the polynomial at two points and showing that it must cross the x-axis (thus having a real root) because it takes on values of opposite signs at these points.\n\nBoth the text and the solution apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to show the existence of a certain value (a root in the problem statement, and y^n = x in the text). While the contexts are different—one is finding a root of a polynomial, and the other is finding a root of a real number—the underlying principle of using IVT to establish the existence of a value between two points remains the same. \n\nGiven this, the text could help a student understand the application of the IVT in a slightly different context, potentially aiding in grasping how IVT can be used to prove the existence of a value (in the problem's case, a real root) within a certain interval.

This theorem fundamentally relies on the concept of continuity and the existence of a point meeting a specific condition within a closed interval, akin to how the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is applied in the solution of the given problem. Although Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem is not the same as the IVT, the reasoning in the text ultimately appeals to the IVT to prove the existence of a fixed point. The proof in the text makes a transition to using the IVT by defining a new function that demonstrates the change of signs over an interval, thereby allowing for the conclusion that there exists a point where the function equals zero. This is conceptually similar to how the solution uses the IVT to show the existence of a real root for the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) by demonstrating a sign change over an interval. Therefore, the text can be helpful for a student by showing a related application of the IVT, even though it discusses a different theorem.

However, the problem statement asks whether a specific polynomial has any real roots, which is a different question from proving that a positive real number has a real square root. Despite this difference, the text does show an application of the Intermediate Value Theorem in a somewhat related context, as it demonstrates the theorem's utility in proving the existence of a value within a certain range that satisfies a specific condition (in the text's case, finding a real number whose square equals another positive real number).\n\nThe solution to the problem uses the Intermediate Value Theorem directly to show that a polynomial must have a root within a certain interval, based on the change of sign of the polynomial's values at the endpoints of the interval. While the context and specific function (polynomial vs. square root function) are different, the underlying application of the Intermediate Value Theorem is conceptually similar: both use the theorem to deduce the existence of a value within an interval that satisfies a given equation (either $x^5 + x - 1 = 0$ or $y^2 = x$).\n\nTherefore, while the text does not directly address polynomials or the specific problem statement, it does provide a relevant illustration of how the Intermediate Value Theorem can be applied to demonstrate the existence of a solution within a certain interval for a continuous function. This could be helpful for a student not familiar with the theorem, as it offers an example of the theorem's application in a proof, even though the context is slightly different. Thus, the text can be helpful in understanding the reasoning and methodology behind using the Intermediate Value Theorem to solve the given problem, despite the difference in the specific function being examined.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Root of Equation e^x (x - 1) = e^-x (x + 1): The given text illustrates an application of the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to determine the existence of a root for a different equation, $e^x (x - 1) = e^{-x} (x + 1)$. The text demonstrates using the theorem by evaluating the function at two points to show that it takes on values of opposite signs, thereby concluding that a root exists between those two points. This process mirrors the solution approach for the original problem of determining if $p(x) = x^5 + x - 1$ has any real roots. The solution to the original problem also involves applying the IVT by evaluating the polynomial at two points to find values of opposite signs and hence concludes the existence of at least one real root within that interval. Thus, the reasoning steps in the text align closely with the steps used in the solution, employing the IVT in a similar manner to solve a problem of finding a real root of an equation.

The solution concludes that the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) is also 0.\n\nThe text provides a detailed explanation and proof of the Squeeze Theorem, which states that if for all \\(x\\) in an interval around \\(a\\) (except possibly at \\(a\\)), \\(g(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq h(x)\\) and the limits of \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) are both \\(L\\), then the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) is also \\(L\\). This is directly applicable to the given problem, where the function \\(f(x)\\) is \"squeezed\" between \\(0\\) and \\(0\\) (since the absolute value \\(|f(x)|\\) approaches \\(0\\), \\(f(x)\\) can be thought of as being between \\(0\\) and \\(0\\)), leading to the conclusion that the limit of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nFurthermore, the text discusses a special case that mirrors the conditions of the problem statement, where \\(L = 0\\) and it's shown through a proof that the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) (or \\(c\\) in the problem statement) is \\(0\\). This closely aligns with the reasoning steps and application of the theorem in the solution to the given problem.\n\nTherefore, the text is helpful in understanding and solving the given problem as it uses very similar reasoning steps as the solution and applies the Squeeze Theorem in a related way as the solution applies the theorem to solve the problem.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Squeeze Theorem/Sequences/Real Numbers: The given text presents a detailed explanation of the Squeeze (Sandwich) Theorem in the context of sequences, focusing on sequences that converge to a limit \\(l\\). It outlines that if a sequence \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) is always between two other sequences \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{z_n\\}\\) that both converge to the same limit \\(l\\), then the sequence \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) must also converge to that limit \\(l\\). This explanation mirrors the core principle of the Squeeze Theorem as defined for functions within calculus, which is about the behavior of functions rather than sequences. However, the underlying logic of comparison and limits is fundamentally similar.\n\nThe problem statement and solution provided deal with the limit of a function \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches a certain point \\(c\\), specifically when the absolute value of that function approaches 0. The solution leverages the understanding that if \\(|f(x)|\\) approaches 0, then \\(f(x)\\) itself must approach 0, aligning with the general intuition behind the Squeeze Theorem without directly invoking the comparison between two other functions or bounds.\n\nAlthough the text discusses sequences and their limits rather than functions and their limits at a point, the conceptual bridge between sequences and functions regarding limits and the behavior of being \"squeezed\" between two converging behaviors is intact. This demonstrates the application of the theorem in a closely related but distinct mathematical setting (sequences vs. functions). Given this, the text can help a student unfamiliar with the theorem understand the foundational idea behind the solution to the problem: that the behavior of something (whether a sequence or a function) can be determined by its bounds.\n\nTherefore, despite the difference in context (sequences vs. continuous functions), the text provides valuable insight into the reasoning and principles underlying the Squeeze Theorem, which can assist in understanding and solving the given problem by illustrating the concept of limits and the behavior of functions or sequences within those limits.\n\nAnswer: True", "id": "TheoremQA_elainewan/math_calculus_2_7.json", "excluded_ids": [], "gold_ids_long": ["N/A"], "gold_ids": ["10521", "21758", "21762"], "gold_answer": "N/A"},

While the problem statement focuses on the absence of directed cycles in a directed graph under a specific condition (an ordered numbering of nodes that prevents links to lower-numbered nodes), the solution confirms this leads to the absence of directed cycles, aligning with the concept of an acyclic graph as mentioned in the theorem definition.\n\nAlthough the text does not explicitly address the problem statement's scenario of ordered numbering of nodes or the specific application of the theorem to directed graphs, it provides a fundamental understanding of acyclic graphs by defining a characteristic (infinite girth) that only acyclic graphs possess—no cycles. This characteristic is directly relevant to understanding why the provided condition (no links to lower-numbered nodes) ensures the absence of directed cycles, because if such a condition holds, the graph inherently cannot have any cycles, thus making it an acyclic graph.\n\nTherefore, despite the text approaching the concept from a slightly different angle (the concept of girth), it contributes to the foundational understanding necessary for a student to grasp why the problem statement is true when considering the absence of cycles (directed or otherwise) in an acyclic graph.

Although the text does not directly address the problem statement, it provides a foundational understanding of acyclic graphs and conditions that ensure a graph's acyclicity. This background can be instrumental in understanding why a directed graph with an ordering that prevents links to lower-numbered nodes does not contain directed cycles, as it indirectly supports the reasoning that such ordering helps maintain the acyclic nature of the graph. Therefore, the text can be helpful for a student by reinforcing the concept of acyclic graphs, which is essential for understanding why the problem statement is true.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Acyclic Graph: The provided text offers a definition of an acyclic graph, which directly relates to the problem statement by explaining what an acyclic graph is: a graph without any cycles. The problem statement involves determining the truth of a statement about the existence of directed cycles in a directed graph under certain conditions. Since the solution uses the concept of an acyclic graph to justify its answer (True), understanding what an acyclic graph is would be crucial for someone unfamiliar with the concept to solve the problem. The text does not specifically address the directed aspect detailed in the problem statement and solution, but it lays the foundational knowledge needed to understand why a graph with an ordered numbering of nodes that prevents links to lower-numbered nodes does not contain directed cycles (by virtue of being acyclic). Therefore, while the text might not provide a step-by-step match with the solution's reasoning, it applies the theorem (acyclic graph) in a related way by defining what an acyclic graph is, which is necessary for understanding the problem's solution.\n\nAnswer: True", "id": "TheoremQA_xinyi/dag_1.json", "excluded_ids": [], "gold_ids_long": ["N/A"], "gold_ids": ["3778", "13468", "23699"], "gold_answer": "N/A"},

This explanation directly supports the solution's approach, which involves applying Ramsey's theorem to find the smallest \\(n\\) that guarantees a red 4-clique or a blue 5-clique in a complete graph colored with two colors. Since the problem statement is essentially asking for the Ramsey number \\(R(4, 5)\\), and the text provides a clear explanation of how to approach finding such a number through Ramsey's theorem, it would indeed be helpful for a student unfamiliar with the theorem to understand and solve the problem.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nReasoning for Ramsey Number: The provided text elaborates on the definition of the Ramsey number, which is directly relevant to the theorem (Ramsey's theorem) used in the solution of the problem.

It deals with expressions involving sums of more than two terms raised to a power and involves multinomial coefficients, which are calculated similarly to the permutations with repetitions formula used in the solution (n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!)). This makes the multinomial theorem directly applicable to the problem at hand, as it provides a mathematical framework for dealing with permutations of objects where there are repetitions, which is precisely the scenario with the word BANANA.\n\nTherefore, although the theorem mentioned in the solution and the text do not match by name, the reasoning and mathematical principles involved in the text (multinomial theorem) are very similar to those used in the solution (permutations with repetitions).

This determines that both series either converge or diverge together. The solution to the problem applies this theorem by comparing the given series with a known convergent series and finding the limit of the ratio of their terms as n approaches infinity to be a finite positive number (1, in this case).
