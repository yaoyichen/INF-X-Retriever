So the number of cells will be determined by the winds\nthat start either at the equator or the pole and the distance that they can\ncover before being deflected into completely zonal direction.\n\nTo have a rough idea about this distance I tried to estimate this (in a very\nquick, dirty and most likely extremely wrong way) by assuming the simplified\nNavier-Stokes equation in planetary coordinates on synoptic scales:  \n$$\\partial_t \\vec v = 2 \\Omega \\sin\\Theta (\\vec v \\times \\vec z),$$  \nwhere  $\\Theta$  is the planetary latitude,  $\\Omega=\\Omega(\\Theta)$  the\nlocal planetary rotation frequency at the given latitude and  $v_0$  the local\nwind speed, leading to a harmonic equation for the meridional speed  \n$$\\partial_{tt} v_{\\phi} = -(2\\Omega \\sin\\Theta)^2 v_{\\phi},$$  which with the\nusual arguments of scale-analysis gives us a timescale  $\\tau_{\\phi}$  for the\nperiodic movement involved in solutions of that equation, of  \n$$\\tau_{\\phi} \\sim \\frac{1}{2\\Omega \\sin\\Theta}$$  \ncorresponding to a distance  $$ d \\sim \\frac{v_0}{2\\Omega \\sin\\Theta_0}$$\ncovered by the vortex. Of course, I cheated here by assuming the initial speed\n$v_0 = \\text{const}$  and the initial Coriolis-factor constant with  $\\Theta =\n\\Theta_0$  .  \nAs now such a \"structure\" (solution of the above eqs.) will have a size of\n$2d$  in the meridional direction, having space of  $\\pi R_{\\text{planet}}$\nour number of Hadley cells per hemisphere becomes simply  $$N = \\frac{\\pi\nR_{\\text{planet}} \\Omega \\sin\\Theta_0}{v_0}$$  \nWhere we'd need to estimate this number starting at the poles, as the\nCoriolis-parameter vanishes at the equator.\n\nI will later (if I don't forget it) pluck in some numbers and see how bad this\nestimate is, or perhaps someone can try that. Anyway, I'm open for\nimprovements of those arguments from anyone who knows something, but a quick\nlook into Holton, _An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology_ , unfortunately\ndidn't reveal much.\n\nBut to also address your question a little bit further: Of course, we'd need\nto have some climatic model to be able to estimate  $v_0$  and know the speed\nof planetary rotation. Independent of how bad my formula is, the initial\narguments of deflection vs. 'climbing the meridian' should hold for the\nformation of a Hadley cell.  \nReturning winds from higher atmospheric layers, surface friction in the\natmospheric boundary layer will also play a role for an exact calculation.\n\n* * *\n\nAddendum: [ Rhines (1975)\n](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=373502&fileId=S0022112075001504)\nhas however found a relation  $N \\sim R_{planet} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Omega}{v_0}}$  ,\nby considering how turbulent eddies will break up energy-limited by zonal\njets. Also turbulent eddies can provide a good mechanism for justifying a\nlocally constant  $v_0$  , that I simply assumed in my calculation above.\n\nOn the other hand I just noticed a trivial error in my above calculation and\ncleared that. The fraction that is N was the other way round. Sorry for that.\n\n* * *\n\nI wanted to note one other thing that seems important to me (and is perhaps\nalso to anyone on this planet..):  \nWhile this rule of thumb-calculations can work out, there is more physics that\nplay a role in shaping the exact morphology of circulation-cells on a planet.\nNamely the radiative equilibrium in the atmosphere, which links the exact\npositions of those cells to a changing climate.\n\nAs a [ study\n](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n1/full/ngeo.2007.38.html) suggests by\nmeasuring Tropical to Polar-Jet distances and Tropopause heights, those cells\ncan expand and reshape the environment people live in."},

The onset of rain is dependent on many things including\nhumidity, but a specific value of humidity is not a sufficient condition for\nrain.\n\n* * *\n\nWater vapor is a gas and invisible. The amount of water vapor in the air can\nbe expressed as relative humidity (RH) which is the ratio of water vapor\npressure ($e$) and saturation water vapor pressure ($e_s$). Saturation vapor\npressure is the partial pressure of vapor when evaporation and condensation\nrates are equal, represented by RH=100%. When RH > 100% net condensation\noccurs, but water has its own ideas.\n\nIn a mixture of pure dry air and water vapor, water will not condense until\naround 400% RH. Reasons for this are a bit complicated but it has to do with\nvery small droplets being more likely to evaporate as their curvature is very\nlarge ( [ Kelvin effect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_equation) ,\nsaturation vapor pressure is higher over curved surfaces than flat ones).\nLuckily for us, our atmosphere is not pure air but has small particulates\nsuspended in it (aerosols). Some of these aerosols are classed as cloud\ncondensation nuclei (CCN) and enable droplet formation at lower relative\nhumidities. These work by forming a solute in water increasing the energy\nneeded to break bonds and evaporate the water ( [ Raoult's_law\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoult%27s_law) )\n\nThe combined interaction of these are described by [ Köhler theory\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_theory) and describe droplet\ngrowth in terms of drop size, solute and supersaturation (RH-100%). In a\nnutshell, there is a critical drop size below which drop size decreases for\ndecreasing supersaturation and above which drop size _increases_ for\ndecreasing supersaturation. The critical supersaturation is the\nsupersaturation needed to attain the critical drop size, and is generally\nsmall (e.g. 0.3% supersaturation).\n\nDroplets below the critical size are 'haze drops' and these make up the haze\nyou see on very humid days. Drops that reach the critical size can continue to\ngrow to become cloud drops. The condensed water is carried in the air but is\nno longer water vapor and is not part of relative humidity (but does\ncontribute to the parcel density)\n\nSo... when does it rain?\n\nIt rains when water vapor is in the presence of CCN, driven to a\nsupersaturation causing growth to the critical drop size (on the order of\n$\\mu$m) and continuing to grow to cloud drops and further to the much bigger\ndrop sizes that make up drizzle (100-300 $\\mu$m)and rain drops(mm), a process\nthat takes around 40 minutes. Drops will grow until the updraft can no longer\nsupport their mass and then they fall from the cloud as rain.\n\nYour question asks at what humidity does it rain, but what surface humidity\ndetermines is how high the cloud bases are. When the dew point depression (the\ndifference between temperature and dew point) is high, the cloud bases will be\nhigher than when the dew point depression is small. As air rises it cools, and\nat some point 100% RH is attained. If there is forcing for vertical ascent,\nparcels can rise to this height and then to a height where they freely convect\ndue to decreased parcel density caused by the release of energy during\ncondensation (see: [ CAPE\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy) ).\n\nSo far to have rain we've needed water vapor (but not at 100% at the surface),\naerosols to aid condensation (CCN) and a way to cool the air to reach 100% RH\nvia lifting. It is these three things -- moisture, aerosols and cooling, that\nwe need for a rain storm. We can have 100% RH days that are just hazy or foggy\nthat do not rain and we can have days with mextremely little RH (e.g. deserts)\nthat result in little rainstorms or large severe storms. We also have storms\nwe call 'elevated convection' that are completely disconnected from surface\nconditions and when these storms cause rain is not related to surface humidity\nat all.\n\nIf you are looking for a magic trigger for rain, your closest bet will be\nlooking at temperature, dew point and the height parcels need to attain to\nfreely convect ( [ LFC\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_free_convection) ). If there is\nforcing for parcels to get that high and instability above, then rain is a\ngood bet. Forcing for lift can be anything from convergence along a boundary\n(sea breeze, cold front, outflow from another storm), orographic lifting\n(mountains, hills), thermally or dynamically forced.\n\n* * *\n\nTo address your specific concerns:\n\n> Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible\n>\n\n>> Invisible to me would mean that clouds are excluded from humidity.\n\nCorrect, clouds are not part of humidity, they are suspended liquid water\ndrops, usually condensed onto a solute of some kind.\n\n> Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume\n> of air.\n>\n\n>> That again makes me think a cloud must be included.\n\nWater vapor contributes to humidity but water vapor does not include liquid\nwater. Cloud water, ice, snow, rain, grapple, hail all contribute to the total\nmass of a volume of air, but are not humidity.\n\n> The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.\n>\n\n>> Rainfall certainly decreases humidity, but it is not stated at what\npercentage it starts to rain.\n\nHumidity will increase during a rainstorm as rain and puddles evaporate.\nTemperature will decrease toward the wet bulb temperature.

In the Celtic calendar, summer started on 1 May; in the traditional Chinese calendar it is [ 5-7 May ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lixia) . The cultural 'Midsummer' and 'Midwinter' festivals reflect this. \n  * **Astronomical.** The solstices and equinoxes are the starts of the seasons, with summer starting on about 21 June ( [ it varies ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) ). Its use dates back at least to the Romans, and it's used in most western cultures today (apparently not in Russia, Australia, or New Zealand). \n  * **Meteorological.** This is what professional meteorologists use (e.g. [ UK Met Office ](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/2014/summer) ), and is based on the prevailing weather on land at mid-latitudes. Seasons are 3 months long and summer starts on 1 June. \n\nI've tried to illustrate the relationships with insolation and temperature\nhere:\n\n![Different ways to reckon seasons](https://i.sstatic.net/gWNb5.png)\n\nThere are some other ways too:\n\n  * **Ecological.** Scientists who study the behaviour of organisms (hibernation, blooming, etc.) adapt to the local climate, [ sometimes using 6 seasons ](http://seasons2011.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ecological-seasons.html) in temperature zones, or only 2 in polar and tropical ones. \n  * **Agricultural.** This would centre around [ the growing season ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_season) and therefore, in North America and Europe at least, around frost. \n  * **Cultural.** What people think of as 'summer', and what they do outdoors (say), generally seems to line up with local weather patterns. In my own experience, there's no need for these seasons to even be 3 month long; When I lived in Calgary, summer was July and August (hiking), and winter was December to March (skiing). [ Here's another example ](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/yawuru/index.shtml) of a 6-season system, and [ a 3-season system ](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/maung/index.shtml) , from the Aboriginal people of Australia, all based on weather. \n\nWhy do systems with later season starting dates prevail today? Perhaps because\nat mid-latitudes, the [ seasonal lag\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag) means that the start of seasonal\nweather is weeks later than the start of the 'insolation' period. In a system\nwith no [ heat capacity ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity) , there\nwould be no lag.

In shallow water, the water particles near\nthe crest move **forward** faster than those below them. Similarly, the\nparticles near the trough move **backward** faster than those above them. This\ncauses strong shearing of the near-surface body of water, eventually forming a\nplunging breaker, or a surf wave. For small-slope (linear) and inviscid (no\nfriction) waves, the above is a consequence of the bottom boundary condition\nfor the water velocity to be zero at the sea floor.\n\nThere are two fundamental and related properties of water waves that\ncontribute to shoaling. One is the wave frequency $\\omega$ remaining constant\nas the depth $d$ decreases. Think of this as the conservation of wave crests\nat any fixed point. However, the wavenumber $k$ (wavelength $\\lambda$) must\nincrease (decrease) with decreasing depth, as per the [ dispersion\nrelationship ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_%28water_waves%29) of\nwater waves (neglecting the effects of viscosity):\n\n$$\\omega^{2} = gk\\tanh{(kd)}$$\n\nwhere $g$ is gravitational acceleration. In shallow water, the dispersion\nrelationship reduces to:\n\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{gd}k $$\n\nand phase speed $C_p$ and group velocity $C_g$ are both proportional to the\nsquare root of the water depth:\n\n$$ C_p = \\dfrac{\\omega}{k} = \\sqrt{gd} $$\n\n$$ C_g = \\dfrac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial k} = \\sqrt{gd} $$\n\nIndividual wave crests propagate with phase speed $C_p$. Wave groups and wave\nenergy propagate with group velocity $C_g$. Thus, waves entering shallow water\nbecome **shorter** and **slower** . The second important property leading to\nshoaling is the conservation of wave energy flux, which is proportional to the\ngroup velocity and wave energy:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial(C_{g}E)}{\\partial x}=0$$\n\nBecause the group velocity decreases, the wave energy (read: height) must\nincrease (locally). This causes the waves to grow in height as they enter\nshallow water. As pointed out by @IsopycnalOscillation in a comment above, the\nseparation of water particles from the wave crests happen because the\nindividual orbital velocities at the top of the crest exceed by far the phase\nspeed of the wave.\n\nAlthough bottom friction is significant and non-negligible in shallow water,\nit does not cause shoaling. Mathematically, wave shoaling can occur for\ncompletely inviscid and small-slope (linear) waves that propagate into water\nof decreasing depth."},

This is, however, plenty of evidence that the moon formed due\nto a collision of a third body (sometimes referred to as Theia) with the\nEarth, and the moon formed from the ring of debris that resulted from the\ncollision.\n\nThis theory is often known as the _[ Giant Impact Hypothesis\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis) _ and searching for\nthis term may help you find other links and references elsewhere.\n\n> If so what is that evidence?\n\nTo summarise the geological evidence, much of it is **indirect** evidence, in\nthat it compares geology on the Moon with similar geology or features on the\nEarth, and draws conclusions to explain the similarities (or discrepancies).\n\nBecause of the sheer size of the proposed impact, it would have likely\nreconfigured the surfaces of both bodies entirely, and so finding direct\nphysical evidence on the Earth would be extremely unlikely. (e.g. a massive\nhidden crater would simply no longer exist)\n\n##  Geological Evidence\n\n  * Moon rocks collected from the Apollo missions that have almost identical oxygen isotope ratios to similar rocks found on Earth of the same age. \n  * A large portion of the Lunar crust is made up of Anorthosite, which is indicative of a large melting event. (with the energy for this supplied from the impact) \n  * Zinc. Lunar rocks contain less zinc, but with heavier _isotopes_ of Zn than those found on Earth, which by contrast has lighter isotopes in greater abundance. This is consistent with zinc being depleted from the moon by evaporation, such as during a massive impact event. \n\n  * Density and volatiles. The Moon is 25% less dense than the uncompressed density of Earth. It is severely depleted in volatiles, with practically no water and less than half the potassium abundance that Earth has. The combination of low density and lack of volatiles implies that the Moon was not a simple accretion of early solar system material, but resembles the Earth's mantle in bulk composition. Volatile material would have been vapourised by the impact. \n\n  * The bulk composition of the Moon's crust. (This one does not actually involve the Earth, but I feel it is still important to mention.) The Moon's mantle and crust chemical composition _could_ be explained if the Moon had a large iron core, but its core is actually quite small. \n\n##  Other Physical Evidence\n\n  * The ratio of the Earth and Moon's mass far exceeds any other planet in the solar system, and this begs the question of how did so much material become in orbit of the Earth. (Not evidence as such, but raises the question in the first place) \n\n  * Getting more indirect...there are bands of warm silica-rich dust orbiting nearby stars which is interpreted as planet-sized bodies having collided with each other, so there is precedent for similar events happening elsewhere in the galaxy. (Again, I realise this is one is not strictly answering the question, but Earth Scientists often have to look well outside the Earth to answer their questions!) \n\nHope this gets you started!\n\n**Update:** I recently came across [ this short article\n](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/where-did-moon-come) , which provides\na summary of some of the latest thinking on the Moon's formation, including\nthe Giant Impact Hypothesis.\n\n_Sources:[ de Pater and Lissauer (2010): Planetary Sciences\n](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Planetary_Sciences.html?id=RaJdy3_VINQC)\n; [ Canup and Asphaug (2001), Nature\n](http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/canup_Moon_Nature_01.pdf) _"},

That'll probably help more than my answer,\nwhich is based around the forecasting classes that I took and my experience as\na forecaster in the university's student-run weather service.\n\nFrom the outside, the forecast process is a very mysterious thing.

It also takes a lot of time to do it right. Here is my pattern\nif I want to be rigorous.\n\n  1. Know where I am forecasting for. \n\nLocation is important. What do I know about the climatology. Climatology can\ngive a \"first guess\" on the range of values that can be reasonably considered.\nThe previous day's weather can also be a good first guess. If I am well\nacquainted with the area, then this becomes a shorter and shorter step.\n\n  2. Start with observations. \n\nWhat is happening now? What is reality saying? The amount of space that is\nlooked at needs to be proportionate to the forecast time.\n\n  3. Make inferences on the current state and causes of weather features. \n\nWhat patterns are seen? Was map analysis done? Are there certain areas that\nare colder than others? Are there places that have clouds and others that\ndon't have clouds? What does the radar say? Why, why why why why? If you know\nthe mechanisms that are generating weather now, then you can understand how\nthey might evolve.\n\n  4. Examine how the weather models have started. \n\nBefore you use a weather model, you should understand it. Garbage in=garbage\nout, _sometimes_ . How well did the model do today? If it is overpredicting\ntemperature right now, will it continue overpredicting the temperature? Will\nthe errors that occurred upstream yesterday occur today?\n\n  5. Look at how the weather models progress. Question if it aligns with my knowledge and experience. \n\nTaking a model at face value might work for research purposes (unless you are\nresearching the model itself), but shouldn't be done on a practical level or\nin a rush. What does Model Output Statistics (MOS) say?\n\n  6. Choose the right numbers or features. \n\nThis is probably the step that requires the least amount of explanation.\nThough the more intricate the type of forecast, the harder and harder this\nbecomes. Does it actually require numbers, or is there some sort of GIS\nsoftware (like for hurricane trajectory or lightning forecast)?\n\n  7. Verify \n\nThis can't be stated enough. You must verify how well you did. Decisions need\nto be made on how the forecast will be verified. What data sources do you know\nof for verification? If I could move this up to number 1 and still have this\nmake sense, I would. Because this is what you should start off with. This\nactually goes part and parcel with starting with observations, since\nobservations are what you start a forecast with. Understand the processes of\nwhy your forecast was off.

I'll try to summarize here.\n\nWhen wind blows over water, the top of the water starts moving. It shears\nagainst the water below it, so that water starts moving too. The momentum from\nthe wind is transferred down into lower layers of the water. This water also\nfeels the Coriolis force. The direction it ends up moving in depends on the\nbalance of friction/drag and Coriolis force. On average, the water moves to\nthe right of the wind in the northern hemisphere; if the wind is blowing\nnorthward, the water moves eastward.\n\nNow imagine you have strong wind blowing northward at one location and weaker\nwind to the right of it. The water at the first location moves to the right,\nand it does so faster than the water at the second location (because the wind\nforcing the water is stronger at the first location). The water converges at\nthe second location, pushing the water downward. This is how the curl of the\nwind stress (the northward wind changing in the east-west direction) is\nrelated to the water convergence (the eastward current changing in the east-\nwest direction) and hence to water being pushed down or pulled up. Positive\nwind stress curl pulls water up; negative wind stress curl pushes it down.\n\nThe last relevant part here is that this kind of motion suppresses ocean\nmixing. The relevant sentence from that paper is\n\n> The wind stress curl and hence Ekman pumping anomalies were negative, which\n> also is consistent with relatively weak entrainment.\n\n\"Entrainment\" is how much of the deep, cold ocean water mixes with the\nrelatively warm upper ocean water, cooling it. The negative wind stress curl\nleads to water being pushed down and less deep water mixing with the upper\nocean. The upper ocean stayed warmer, so the whole heat blob lasted longer."},
