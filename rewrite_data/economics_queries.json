The article explains it the two paragraphs\nbefore:\n\n> Multinational companies also steal money from developing countries through\n> “same-invoice faking”, shifting profits illegally between their own\n> subsidiaries by mutually faking trade invoice prices on both sides. For\n> example, a subsidiary in Nigeria might dodge local taxes by shifting money\n> to a related subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, where the tax rate is\n> effectively zero and where stolen funds can’t be traced.\n\nTax dodging is not theft according to dictionary definition but I believe the\nauthor is using the word theft metaphorically here (e.g. like when Nozick when\nhe said 'taxation is theft' or when Proudhon said 'property is theft', of\ncourse its not meant literally).\n\n**On Impact of Tax Dodging on Economic Development**\n\nThis is topic that is not yet well understood as some other areas of economics\ndue to lack of data. However, what research there is suggest that tax\navoidance negatively impacts economic development (e.g. see reviews of\nliterature such as: [ Fuest & Riedel, 2009\n](https://rybn.org/thegreatoffshore/THE%20GREAT%20OFFSHORE/7.RESOURCES/ACADEMIC%20PAPERS/TAX%20EVASION/Tax%20evasion,%20tax%20avoidance%20and%20tax%20expenditures%20in%20developing%20countries%20-%20A%20review%20of%20the%20literature.pdf)\n; [ Cobham, 2005\n](https://rybn.org/thegreatoffshore/THE%20GREAT%20OFFSHORE/7.RESOURCES/ACADEMIC%20PAPERS/TAX%20EVASION/Tax%20evasion,%20tax%20avoidance%20and%20tax%20expenditures%20in%20developing%20countries%20-%20A%20review%20of%20the%20literature.pdf)\n).\n\nThe reason why tax avoidance harms economic development is that it reduces the\ngovernment revenue that could be in principle used for provision of public\ngoods. Public goods such as for example, provision of effective police that\nprotects people and their property, or effective courts etc. In turn these\npublic goods and institutions they protect are crucial to economic development\n(e.g. see [ Acemoglu and Robinson 2012\n](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/publications/why-nations-fail-origins-\npower-prosperity-and-poverty) ). However, what is less clear is whether some\ndeveloping countries would actually in a contrafactual world where they get\nthis extra tax revenue spent it on such public goods or used it to prop up\ncorrupt regime (e.g. how oil revenue is often used by dictatorships to stay in\npower).\n\nHowever, the caveat above being said, its not unreasonable to state that such\ntax dodging probably negatively affects economic development. Even if the\nevidence is not completely conclusive its thought that it is more likely than\nnot to have negative effect."},

Most modern governments cannot print money directly. They can do it indirectly, most central banks (which are government institutions) can buy government bonds with newly created reserves. Some central banks such as ECB have even power to actually print money. This is analogous to financing government with printing new money. However, in developed countries central banks are nominally independent (like courts or police force) from central government. Hence this option is, in most countries, only available if technocrats at the central bank are willing to play ball with government. \n\n  2. Even in cases where executive power in the government does control money supply or central bank is willing to play ball, monetizing government finances results in larger inflation. There are numerous empirical studies that show there is (sometimes endogenous) causal effect of money supply on inflation (e.g see [ Grauwe & Polan (2005) ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9442.2005.00406.x?casa_token=eB3vl6f0WOMAAAAA:6uR2-Wov04WFV2K6ZBLO--Az7Z5KWLLPgiXfLMy-IrL3xrvZShOwiDC-gU_I4_me4ak5vI39UFEspwZA) or [ Frain (2004) ](https://www.esr.ie/ESR_papers/vol35_3/Vol%2035_3Frain.pdf) ). So there is a trade-off here between monetizing spending and inflation. \n\n  3.

Government intertemporal budget constraint is\ngiven byL\n\n$$G = T + \\theta - B$$\n\nWhere  $G$  is government spending,  $T$  tax net of interest payment,\n$\\theta$  high powered money (i.e. monetizing gov finances) and  $B$\ngovernment borrowing.\n\nNow to circle back to your question:\n\n> what are the pros and cons of increasing taxes or printing more money or\n> selling bonds?\n\nThe pros of using  $B$  or  $\\theta$  is that government does not have to\nraise taxes now (which is unpopular), depresses _current_ economic activity\nand leads to deadweight loss to economy which is just pure waste for society.\nThe con of  $B$  is that government will have to raise even more taxes in the\nfuture (to cover for spending and interest).

It was typically done every 5-10 years by\nvarious statistical offices, although now some do it on yearly basis.\n\nThe reason why this is done is that CPI does not actually look at all prices\nbut just some sample of representative prices. This had to be done because,\nespecially in the past, but to some extent even now, data collection is\nextremely expensive so statistical offices would not be able to afford to\ntrack all prices. Nowadays, there are indices that are more comprehensive like\n[ the billion prices project ](https://thebillionpricesproject.com/) but such\nmethodology is not widely used by statistical offices yet.\n\nHowever, using representative basket of goods introduces problem when consumer\nspending patterns shift, since to make index consistent you need to compare\nthe prices of the same basket of goods.

For example, if you buy car parts and assemble them into cars, the costs of the cars will be reflected in your sales but it isn't your output. \n  2. In an internationally active firm, some firm output should sometimes be counted in the GDP of other countries. For example, if you make cars in the US and China, you are going to contribute to the GDP of both countries but your sales will reflect both countries' output. \n\nFor a domestic firm, in a setting where GDP = GDI, we can think of the firm's\ncontribution to GDP as the contribution to income.

Big countries such as USA or Russia or China might not go all the way\nto stone age but the welfare standards would plunge by decades if not\ncenturies and most modern comforts would not be widely accessible to public.\n\nEven if we would allow trade in commodities that are not physically present in\nhome country it would lead to major economic disaster. People trade precisely\nbecause trade is beneficial. Carpenters do not grow their own food, they\nspecialize in what they can do comparatively better than other people and then\ntrade for food with farmers. The same way countries specialize in what they\ncan do comparatively better and then trade. This leads to higher living\nstandards, because if someone focuses only on farming that person can produce\nmore food than someone who is not specialist farmer but a jack of all trades\nmaster of none.\n\nIn many places that might even cause famines since some countries have higher\npopulation than can be sustained without any import of food (e.g. Singapore).\nIt would certainly lead to great decrease of human population globally, not\nonly because it would lead to lack of food.\n\nThis being said of course it is technically possible to do it if people would\nbe fine with massive decrease with living standards. But it would be very hard\nsince people would try to break law and trade with foreigners anyway (people\nsmuggle even when there are just minimal restriction on trade) so it would\nrequire very heavy handed response from the government, similar to USSR iron\ncurtain that every country would have to maintain (e.g. heavily\nfortified/guarded border walls). In addition, I do not believe any democratic\nelectorate would be willing to put out with becoming impoverished so I do not\nbelieve that this would be possible to implement without autocracy. Even if\npeople would foolishly vote for this they would promptly vote against it once\nthe effects would become visible.\n\nYou can see that on the case of Brexit. Brexit is not even a full autarky\n(which is what you propose), it is just exist from free trade area with EU\nthat makes trade for Britain little bit more difficult, yet it causes\nsignificant loss of welfare (approximately 6.3-9.5% loss in GDP per capita in\nlong term and immediate loss of about 2.6% in short run - [ Dhingra et al 2016\n](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66144/) ). As a consequence many voters say now\nthey would switch their vote ( [ yougov\n](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/02/02/britons-\nwould-vote-remain-are-less-sure-about-re-j) ).\n\nYour proposal would be like Brexit on steroids, the effects would be of\nseveral magnitudes larger.\n\n> Would the robustness of an economy without trade and other benefits I’m not\n> sure of right now be worth any downsides, such as economic strain (because\n> countries aren’t getting money from trade agreements and are using more on\n> attempting to find a way to obtain certain resources without trade)?\n\nThis is question for moral philosophers to answer.\n\nTrade makes people better off, it allows them to achieve higher standards of\nwelfare and it reduces poverty. On the other hand it probably hurts more to be\nrich and than having your riches to be taken away from you than always being\npoor because people get used to the comfort and if you never experienced good\nlife then you don't know what you are missing.\n\nA science cannot determine whether the benefit of always being poor and thus\nrobust to loss of riches is better than being rich with some small but real\nprobability of becoming poor. That is for moral philosophers to ponder.\n\nIt would be equivalent of asking engineer whether costs of building buildings,\nwith all the modern comforts, in places where there are earthquakes, are worth\nthe benefit of forcing people to live in tents but having city virtually\nimmune to earthquakes. After all, if everyone lives in tents then city is\nrobust to any earthquake because even heavy earthquake will do minimal damage\nif there are no firm structures in the city. So is it worth to make the\nexchange? That's a philosophical question.\n\n> Also, what would happen to the global economy as a whole?\n\nWithout question it would collapse. That would be the largest global recession\nworld had ever seen. Covid-19 disrupted supply chains and economic activity a\nlittle bit and it caused greater recession than 2008 financial meltdown. This\nwould be without question largest economic recession in history of mankind.\n\nAs already mentioned above even relatively small disruption to UK trade could\nlead to 6.3-9.5% loss in national income per capita. Complete autarky would\nlead to drop that would be much higher, there are no studies that would\ncalculate impacts of such far fetched ideas as complete autarky but if\nhypothetically some study would say the world output would contract by 5-8\ntimes more it would not raise eyebrows.\n\nAutarky is man-made disruption of world supply chains. The effect on world\neconomy from a volcano or pandemic that would completely shut down trade will\nbe similar effect as when politicians decide to shut down trade.\n\n> Which countries would be most and least affected and in what ways?\n\nGeographically small countries with limited resources would be most affected.\nThey would experience economic collapse and return to low living standards\nthat our ancestors had in distant past. Geographically large countries with\nlot of natural resources would be least affected but they would still\nexperience significant and in modern times unprecedented drop in living\nstandards.\n\n* * *\n\nAnswer to new edited question:\n\n> Would the increased robustness of an autarkic economy outweigh any economic\n> costs (many of these could be alleviated by gradually making the switch)\n> such as increased expenditure on finding ways to obtain certain resources\n> without trade?\n\nNo. Problem with sudden loss of trade is not just that it is sudden, it is the\nloss of trade itself. Of course, making the process gradual would ease the\npain little bit, similarly as getting unemployed without severance is worse\nthan when there is some transitional period with severance, but in the end you\nend up unemployed anyway.\n\nTrade itself is beneficial and increases material standards of living (see for\nexample discussion in Krugman et al International Economics: Theory and Policy\nCh 1-3). Of course, any unexpected negative shock is worse than slow expected\nnegative shock, but removing trade still creates negative shock.\n\nHere we again can use Brexit as a case study. Brexit did not happen overnight.\nFirst UK leaving EU free trade area took 2 years after article 50 was invoked\n(and this article was not invoked immediately after the referendum). So UK\nleaving EU was almost 3 year process. In addition, it was not even completely\nunexpected shock as polling was showing the vote was very close so people\nalready had chance to start preparing even before for this eventuality.\n\nYet as discussed above the Brexit had immediate negative effects, and what\neven more, the research estimates that the long-term negative effects will be\neven _worse_ then short term ones. This is because trade has not just static\npositive effect (it allows economies to produce and operate on higher level)\nbut it also has dynamic effects that allows countries to progress faster (see\nKrugman et al Ch 3). So removing it (even taking the surprise factor out of\nthe equation) creates double whammy of reducing the production possibilities\nof the country immediately and retarding the growth of production\npossibilities of the country in the future. Since economic growth is\ncompounding this can have profound effects over time. If we have two equal\ncountries starting with 100 GDP per capita but one grows at 2% and another one\nat 1% per year then over 100 year period faster growing country will have GDP\nper capita of 724.46, and slow growing country 270.48. By removing the\nunexpected shock you might be able to mitigate the immediate damage but it\nwon't help mitigate much if any of the long term damage that is even higher\nthan the immediate damage.\n\nAgain there is a philosophical debate about whether its better to live in\nstable poverty, or live at high standards of living with some risks that there\nmight be periods of time when those standards of living drop. However, there\nis no question that material standards of living themselves will be higher in\ntrading countries (even factoring in occasional disruptions during global\ndisasters) than in countries under autarky."},

A trade occurs if a bid and ask are matched.\n\nThe matching relies on a double ordering. The principle to remember here is\n\"buy low, sell high\". Also, remember that the ask is the _minimum_ price a\nwould-be seller is happy to sell, while the bid is the _maximum_ price a\nwould-be buyer is happy to buy. The buy and sell offers are ordered in the\nfollowing way:\n\n  * **Asks** : lowest first, highest last, then in the order they were submitted. \n  * **Bids** : highest first, lowest last, then in the order in which they were submitted. \n\nThis is called **price-time-priority matching** (see [ here\n](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/matchingorders.asp#:%7E:text=Under%20a%20basic%20FIFO%20algorithm,order%20at%20a%20lower%20price.)\n). Many exchanges use a variant of that procedure with potentially some\nextensions. An important exception is the NYSE, which has a pro-rate system on\ntop (see [ here ](https://www.nyse.com/article/parity-priority-explainer) ),\nbut this is not relevant for your cases.\n\n> What happens when the bid is higher than the ask? For example, someone is\n> ready to pay \\$101 per share for 100 shares, and someone wants to sell 100\n> shares at \\$100. What will be the new price?\n\nThe matching in this case depends on the order in which instructions were\nsubmitted and on the _best price rule_ , which says that whoever submits last\ngets the best available price. One motivation for that rule is that agents\nshouldn't be punished for submitting limit orders. After all, if that\nprinciple were not in place, agents who act last could instead put in market\norders (without a limit), where a buyer immidiately buys at the lowest ask,\nand a seller sells at the highest bid, which may result in a better deal for\nthe agent last to act. If not in place, you wouldn't get many limit orders, if\nany at all. So this rule favors market liquidity.\n\nApplying these rules, if the sell offer at \\$100 was there first, the buyer,\neven though she is happy to pay \\$101, will only pay 100. Conversely, if the\nbuyer places the order first, the seller will sell for 101. So, depending on\nthe order of submission, the resulting price will be either 100 or 101.\n\n> What if there are multiple matches at an instance? Let's say we have someone\n> wanting to buy 100 shares at \\$100 and someone wanting to sell 100 shares at\n> $100. We also have someone wanting to buy 500 shares at \\$110 and someone\n> wanting to sell 500 shares \\$110. What is the new price?\n\nAgain, the matching depends on the double ordering mentioned above and the\nbest price principle. I won't go through all possible cases, but provide a few\n**illustrations** :\n\n  * Bid = 500@\\$110. The seller comes in with 100@\\$100. The trade is executed at the best price (for the seller) at \\$110. (if they submit in the reverse order, the trade will happen at a price of \\$100) \n\n  * Bid = 100@\\$100, Ask = 500@\\$110. There is no match. Ask = 100@\\$100 comes in, \"jumps the queue,\" and 100 shares are traded at \\$100. \n\n  * Bid = 100@\\$100, Ask = 500@\\$110. There is no match. A new bid comes in with 500@\\$110. It jumps the bid queue and is matched with the ask, and the trade happens at a price of \\$100. \n\nNote that time-stamping these days is very accurate, to within one millisecond\n(see for example [ here\n](https://www.npl.co.uk/getattachment/5b94a9f8-bd79-478e-ba25-8fc56f51be33/NPLTime_Complete_Guide.pdf.aspx?lang=en-\nGB&ext=.pdf) ).

For short, this does neither affect the interest rate (in an\nample reserves regime), nor the liquidity ratio (LCR) / capital requirement of\na bank. The latter statement requires that the central bank is purchasing a\nhighly liquid (level 1) asset though (which US government bonds are).\n\nInsofar, as written in your post, a purchase of government bonds by the FED\nhas\n\n> no direct impact on credit creation,\n\nat least not via the LCR or interest rate channel. I am inclined to believe\nthat this was the argument made by whoever you heard this from.

The FED also does not (anymore) target\nmonetary aggregates when conducting monetary policy. I believe reading [ this\nanswer ](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/49858/40033) might be\ninteresting, although many others have different opinions about this subject.\n\n**Edit**\n\nCommercial bank credit is NOT part of M1. When a bank provides a loan, the\nborrower receives a deposit. From the perspective of commercial banks balance\nsheets, this increases credits on the assets side and customer deposits on the\nliabilities side. Most of the times (with mortgages it is frequently directly\nsent to seller of the house / or mortgage notary's account) this deposit is\nwithdrawn quickly and usually sent to another bank (unless the seller's bank\naccount is at the same bank as the buyer's). Therefore, an individual\ncommercial bank cannot generate lasting increases in its deposits by granting\nloans.\n\nHowever, the banking system as a whole does see an increase in deposits (thus\nmoney supply) despite constant amounts of central bank money. Leaving\npotential reserve requirements aside, the bank will still have risk/return\nconsiderations to take into account when providing loans. From an asset\nliability management perspective, loans are long-term claims on the assets\nside, while sight deposits are typically liquid and short-term liabilities. In\nessence, that is one of the main reasons justifying commercial banking - it's\nan intermediary that brings together investors and savers despite their\ndiverging requirements. Banks can offer this service because they can\ndiversify the credit and liquidity risks better than individuals.\n\nFor risk management, banks need to consider factors such as current and future\ninterest rate on loans and deposits, the likelihood of deposit withdrawals and\ncredit defaults and the like. On top of this, banks are tightly regulated.\nBanks need to follow the standards of Basel III, which consist of 3 Pillars\n\n  * Pillar 1: Capital requirements ( [ Capital Ratio ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_adequacy_ratio) , [ Leverage Ratio ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III#Leverage_ratio) ,..), Credit risk, Market risk, [ Operational Risk ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_risk) as well as [ LCR & NSFR ](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu201910_2%7E3237802727.en.html) . \n  * Pillar 2: mainly supervision like the Supervisory Review Evaluation Process ( [ SREP ](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/srep/html/index.en.html#:%7E:text=This%20activity%20is%20called%20the,supervisory%20measures%20to%20be%20taken.) , [ ICAAP & ILAAP ](https://www.eba.europa.eu/guidelines-on-icaap-and-ilaap-information) ,... \n  * Pillar 3: ... \n\nLong story short, banks cannot simply give away loans without end. Also,\ncredit creation by banks relies on a lot more details than the traditional\nreserve requirement (money multiplier) argument suggests. Specifically, it is\nnot just the consideration of outflows (of deposits) and inflows being spread\nover time and normally only being a fraction of total deposits (which is where\nthe name _fractional reserve banking_ originated, as only a fraction of\ncustomer deposits have to be covered all the time). Since deposits created by\nthe banking system belong to the banks’ customers, the main driving force\nbehind credit creation are customers, not banks themselves.\n\nIn fact, the FED does not even aim to affect the broad money supply. St.Louis\nFED research claims it's best to forget what we learnt about money aggregates\nin [ undergrad Econ\n](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-\nthe-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier) . The so called\n_dual-mandate_ aims to (somewhat interestingly) promote three (not two) goals:\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\n\nNeither of these goals mentions money supply. Also, [ New York FED - Money\nSupply ](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed49.html) states\nthat\n\n> In 2000, when the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation requiring the Fed to set\n> target ranges for money supply growth expired, the Fed announced that it was\n> no longer setting such targets, because money supply growth does not provide\n> a useful benchmark for the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nand [ FED - what is money supply\n](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12845.htm) claims that\n\n> Over recent decades, however, the relationships between various measures of\n> the money supply and variables such as GDP growth and inflation in the\n> United States have been quite unstable. As a result, the importance of the\n> money supply as a guide for the conduct of monetary policy in the United\n> States has diminished over time\n\n[ This answer ](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/49858/40033) has a few\ncharts illustrating that total money supply is not really directly impacted by\nmonetary policy.

Mishkin (2007) speech at Bridgewater\nCollege\n](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/mishkin20070410a.htm) .\n\nTo summarize, the main goals of the FED are to keep prices stable and to\npromote full employment (closely related to a healthy economy / GDP). However,\nas just seen, there is only a weak relationship between measures of the money\nsupply and GDP growth and inflation. Therefore, the central bank focuses on\ninterest rates, not only the FED Funds market, but also longer term interest\nrates. Changing interest rates has a direct impact on demand for credit (by\ncustomers) and the risk metrics of banks (current and future interest rate on\nloans and deposits, the likelihood of deposit withdrawals and credit defaults,\nBasel III calculations, ...).\n\nAs written above, monetary policy has evolved considerably. For example, in\nthe EUR area, so called Targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)\naim to offer commercial banks attractive long-term funding conditions. To\nstimulate lending to the real economy, the interest rate is negative and in a\nnutshell, the more loans participating banks issue to non-financial\ncorporations and households (except loans to households for house purchases),\nthe more attractive (the more negative) the interest rate. While ultimately\nthere needs to be demand from customers, these favourable funding conditions\nmake it easier (cheaper) to offer loans."},

I got one in the mail myself when I turned 18, back in the 1990s.) \n\nWhen this is sustainable, the money to do it typically comes from the sale\nprice of the complementary good(s), when and if this is enough to cover losses\nfrom the giveaway. The profit in it comes from the shift in demand, if this\nincreases the quantity of the complement that can be sold or the price at\nwhich it can be sold.\n\n  * In economics jargon, the strategy is a particular form of a [ two-part tariff ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-part_tariff) : there is a lump-sum entry fee for using the composite product (the fixed cost of the razor handle, or the printer, or the Tesla car), and a variable cost for usage (the cost of replaceable blades, or ink cartridges, or electrical charging stations). The basic strategy here is to try to take a loss on the revenue from one of the two parts of the composite product, and subsidize it by increasing revenue from the other. \n\nIn some sense, Tesla's strategy here works in the opposite direction from\nGillette's. Gillette lowers the fixed cost of the razor-blade handle to 0, and\nthen covers the cost from the increased revenue that they make from the\nvariable usage cost (selling new replaceable blades). As you've described it,\nTesla's strategy seems to be to lower to 0 the _variable_ cost of discharging\nyour Tesla car (by driving it around) and then recharging at a Tesla charging\nstation; they presumably hope to cover the cost from the increased revenue\nthat they make from the _fixed_ lump-sum sale price when people buy new\nTeslas. (There are lots of reasons they might think this will be useful for\nincreasing sales; besides any direct financial effects of the subsidy or\npsychological effects toward brand loyalty, the availability of free charging\nstations is also almost certainly intended to help reduce [ range anxiety\n](https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/what-is-range-anxiety-with-\nelectric-vehicles) in prospective customers when they consider buying a new\nTesla.)\n\nWill that turn out to be sustainable over the long term? Well, that depends on\na lot of details, as well as quite a bit of unpredictable luck. In no\nparticular order:\n\n    * How many stations will Tesla build? \n    * How much of the recharging do they expect Tesla drivers to do at company charging stations (as opposed to charging up at home, or charging at a 3rd party charging station)? (I.e., what share of the variable costs of driving a Tesla are they actually expecting to be subsidizing?) \n    * How much does it cost them on the margin to provide the electrical charge? \n    * How much or how little does this boost sales of Tesla cars? (I.e., how much do they expect to increase their revenue from the lump-sum fee?) \n    * How long do people who buy a new Tesla car keep driving it? (I.e., does the lump-sum payment generally have to cover 6 months' worth of driving on average, or 2 years', or 5, or 10, or...? This will make a big difference to how affordable it is likely to be.) \n    * How much does this influence people's likelihood to replace their old Tesla car with a new Tesla car? \n\nThere are a lot of other questions that you might want to ask. If you have\nsome possible ballpark estimates or reasonable minimum-maximum ranges for any\nof these figures -- either in terms of what Tesla might expect the figures to\nbe, or what they might realistically turn out to be in fact, or whatever\nscenario you want to run -- then those could provide some guidance for a more\nconcrete answer to your question. In the absence of that, the best answer\nyou're likely to be able to find is to get some kind of model that will lay\nout the blanks you'd need to be able to fill in to get a concrete answer."},

That means that Russians are limited or in some cases even prevented from exchanging rubles for other currencies. Exchange rates are ultimately determined by supply and demand. If people are not allowed to supply rubbles to the market, ruble supply shifts to the left and that, ceteris paribus, causes exchange rate to appreciate. \n\n  2. Russian central bank increased interest rates to 20% (see [ the economist ](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/business/russias-central-bank-hikes-key-rate-to-20-percent/amp_articleshow/89890648.cms) ) that strengthens the ruble. \n\n  3. Exchange rate often overshoots (see [ Dornbusch 1976 ](https://www.mit.edu/%7E14.54/handouts/dornbusch76.pdf) ). The initial depreciation in ruble likely did not just reflect fundamentals. \n\n  4. Some of it is also because Russia recently started using Gazprombank to partially evade sanctions on Russian central bank (see my [ answer ](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/50980/15517) here about that). Russia essentially requires other countries to pay for energy exports there and Gazprombank then converts the foreign currency to rubles, since it is not sanctioned. \n\n  5. It’s partially also because while the sanctions for sure hurt Russia they do not hurt much Russian energy exports. EU imports 26.9% of oil, 41.1% of gas and 46.7% of coal from Russia (see [ Eurostat ](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html#carouselControls?lang=en) ). These important energy imports are not yet sanctioned and realistically there is no way how EU could manage to get some substitutes for that in near term. As long as Russia can continue its energy exports and as long as exports will be greater than imports (with which the sanctions help actually) Russia will be accumulating current account surplus which will help prop up the ruble."},

However, with\nregards to speed, Matlab should be quicker than Python for DSGE models (any\nmatrix statistics, iteration and recursion and so forth). That is also what\nthe first suggested paper in the accepted answer finds (I only looked at the\nrevised 2018 version). By the way, the conclusion in the paper reads as\nfollows:\n\n> ...

It may not be a difference you really feel or that\nmatters for you, because waiting for 10 or 15 seconds is essentially not a\ndeal breaker.\n\nUnlike Python, Julia is significantly more complex when it comes to potential\ncode implementation. Everything that runs fast in Python is not Python, but C,\nFortran and co. Julia can also turn slow when type inference fails or the JIT\ncompiler has insufficient information to optimize effectively. If you notice\nno speedup to Python, it is either because you use examples (or benchmark that\nway) where compile time latency matters more than computation, or it is\ninefficient code. I did some work a while ago on Julia's speed and comparison\nto Python. I will copy paste some sections in case anyone is interested in\nsome details why Julia is actually fast.\n\nIn dynamic languages like Python, classes could be subclassed.

For this reason, a single integer in ` Python 3.x ` actually contains\nfour pieces:\n\n  * ` ob_refcnt ` , a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation \n  * ` ob_type ` , which encodes the type of the variable \n  * ` ob_size ` , which specifies the size of the following data members \n  * ` ob_digit ` , which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent. \n\nThis means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as\ncompared to an integer in say Julia or C. Python uses 28 bytes to store an\ninteger, Julia only 8 bytes.\n\nA great feature of Julia is that types are extremely lightweight, and user-\ndefined types are exactly as performant as anything built-in: this is a big\ndifference to languages like Python where constructing a new instance of a\nclass is very expensive. The amount of data required to store a Struct (Class)\ncalled Foo is the same as the amount of data required to store a pointer to a\nstring. At compilation, Julia (just like Fortran and C) doesn't have\nadditional overhead contrary to how an object (in say Python) is represented\nin memory (includes type information, reference counter etc).\n\nJulia:\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/rfcFqm.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/rfcFqm.png)\n\nPython:\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/WK8LXm.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/WK8LXm.png)\n\nYou can see the massive overhead in Python. It's probably even better to say\nthat Julia isn't slow (not that it is fast), meaning it doesn't get in the way\nof the hardware and lets the hardware do its job efficiently. Mathematically,\nthe integer 5 is exactly identical to the floating point 5.0, but it has a\ndifferent bitwise representation. This is why Types are important in\ncomputers. Slow programming languages have a very hard time to know in advance\nwhat types things are. So they test for all sorts of combinations to figure\nout what routine to use to call the correct CPU instructions, because at the\nlowest level, the microprocessor has to perform different instructions when\ndealing with for example integers or floats. A microprocessor does not know\ntypes. A CPU needs special instructions for all different types; e.g. signed\nand unsigned integers, floats with single precision or double precision, or\ncombinations of floating points and integers, for which you will need\nconversion (promotion) of types. Usually there will be different special\ninstructions for every possible type.\n\nAs long as your task is computational, Julia will always beat Python (provided\nboth are optimized). Where it starts to matter is when you really work with\nlots of data and / or complex models.\n\nFor example look at the question [ Why is this task faster in Python than\nJulia? ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70987896/why-is-this-task-faster-\nin-python-than-julia) on stackoverflow. It is almost always code written in\nnon-performant ways if you get slow Julia code. Without any optimization, just\ngetting rid of compile time latency, resulted in Julia taking 8s vs 30s in\nPython. Regarding the stackoverflow question, [ Quantinsti\n](https://blog.quantinsti.com/julia-programming/) has some good tests for\nMultiple operations on large datasets. For 100 groups of ~10,000,000 rows,\nPython (pandas package) and R (dplyr package) resulted in an internal error\nand out of memory error, respectively while Julia took 2.4 seconds the first\ntime and 1.8 seconds the second time.\n\nJulia is fast because of its design decisions that allow a compiler to make\nefficient code. This is achieved with type-stability through specialization\nvia multiple-dispatch as a core design decision. To illustrate this, you can\ntry to compute ` 2^3 ` .\n\nIn Julia, you can run ` @code_llvm ` as well as ` @code_native ` macros to\nprint the LLVM bitcodes as well as the native assembly instructions generated\nfor running the method matching the given generic function and type.\n\nIf you use ` @code_llvm exponential(2,3) ` as well as ` @code_llvm\nexponential(2,3) ` and compared it to the 2^3 counterpart, you will be\nsurprised how messy the “manual” exponential solution is compared to Julia’s\nbuilt in.\n\nManual (ignoring almost half the output):\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/5XNk7l.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/5XNk7l.png)\n\nBuilt-in (entire output):\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/FR0qMl.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/FR0qMl.png)\n\nThe built in solution is something you can decipher fairly quickly with some\nbasic assembly.\n\n  * The lines beginning with ` ; ` are comments, and explain which section of the code the following instructions come from. Calling it with ` debuginfo=:none ` removes the comments in the assembly code \n  * ` pushq ` , ` movq ` , ` subq ` and ` addq ` are to save stack frames, move content to or from [ registers ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#Architectural_implications) (the suffix ` q ` is short for ` quad ` , which means 64-bit integer), allocate to registers and dealocate. Neither is important for our purpose. For short, a CPU operates only on data present in registers. These are small, fixed size slots (e.g. 8 bytes in size) inside the CPU itself. A register is meant to hold one single piece of data, like an integer or a floating point number. \n  * ` movabsq ` is the so called [ Exponentiation by squaring ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) . For example if you compute  $x^{15}$  , it will look like this \n\n    \n    \n    x^15 = (x^7)*(x^7)*x \n    x^7 = (x^3)*(x^3)*x \n    x^3 = x*x*x\n    \n\nOr only the last line in our simple example above, which is  $x^3$  only.\n\nThe reason this works is that Julia's built in function made some clever\ndesign decisions. For instance, ` x^-n ` works for an integer ` x ` and\nliteral ` n ` but not for expressions because Julia developers [ defined\n](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/20527) a special syntactic\ntreatment of literals.\n\n  * The benefit is quick and reliable exponentiation for something like  $x^-3$  . The advantage is that [ literal powers ](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/math/#Base.:%5E-Tuple%7BNumber,%20Number%7D) automatically become type-stable, because they turn into a fixed number of * calls. This is why Julia now lowers ` x^-3 ` to ` inv(x)^3 ` . \n  * The downside is that  $p = -3$  and  $x^p$  does not work and throws an error which seems potentially quite confusing. However, the ` x^literal ` has a different meaning than ` x^expression ` . In essence, referential transparency was sacrificed, and type stability \"extended\": That is why ` ^ ` to a literal integer power is different than raising to a variable with the same integer value. \n\n**Note:** The crux here is that type-stability doesn’t mean that the type\nreturned by a function is the same as the input. It means that the type can be\ninferred at every step of the way. If inv of an integer is always a floating\npoint number, then that’s type stable.\n\nThe problem however, is that most casual Python users will expect x^p to work\nfor p = -3.  \n  \n\nSimilarly, scope matters a lot. You can look at this simple function.\n\n    \n    \n    b = 1.0\n    function g(a)\n        global b\n        tmp = a\n        for i in 1:1_000_000\n            tmp = tmp + a + b\n        end\n        return tmp\n    end\n    \n\nb is global here, which is like poison for performance because the type of a\nglobal variable is never certain.\n\nIf you instead write\n\n    \n    \n    function g(a, b)\n        tmp = a\n        for i in 1:1_000_000\n            tmp = tmp + a + b\n        end\n        return tmp\n    end\n    \n\nyou are eliminating the global variable which\n\n• reduces the number of allocations to zero (from 3000001 allocations: 45.78\nMiB)  \n• speeds up execution and  \n• produces clean and fairly simple machine code.\n\nFor short, with some care, Julia can be on par with the fastest languages.\n\nThese allocations matter massively. On my private laptop for example, finding\na single file (including opening and closing the file) takes about 1.4\nmilliseconds. Accessing 1,000,000 integers from memory takes 75.7\nmilliseconds. So my RAM is almost 20,000 times faster than my disk. I ran this\nwith a [ reasonably fast\n](https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/1317771/E12S-512G-PHISON-SSD-B27B)\nSSD but even the newer Optane technology disks are usually thousands of times\nslower than RAM.\n\nI ran a speed test between C, Python and Julia, which is based on a notebook\nfrom an introductory [ MIT math course\n](https://github.com/mitmath/18S096/blob/master/lectures/lecture1/Boxes-and-\nregisters.ipynb) .\n\nIt is a speed comparisons between C, Python and Julia by implementing a\n**sum** function ` sum(a) ` , which computes\n\n$$ \\mathrm{sum}(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i $$\n\nfor an array ` a ` with ` n ` elements. I compared built in ` sum ` functions\nin Julia and Python along with hand-coded implementations in C, Python, and\nJulia. If you are a Windows user and want to replicate this on your own, you\nwill need to install the MinGW (GCC/G++) compiler.\n\nThe C code is:\n\n    \n    \n    C_code = \"\"\"\n    #include <stddef.h>\n    double c_sum(size_t n, double *X) {\n        double s = 0.0;\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            s += X[i];\n        }\n        return s;\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    const Clib = tempname()   # make a temporary file\n    \n    # compile to a shared library by piping C_code to gcc\n    open(`gcc -fPIC -O3 -msse3 -xc -shared -o $(Clib * \".\" * Libdl.dlext) -`, \"w\") do f\n        print(f, C_code) \n    end\n    \n\nJulia's\n\n    \n    \n    function my_sum1(x)\n        result = zero(eltype(x))\n        for element in x\n            result += element\n        end\n        return result\n    end\n    \n\nNot only is the Julia code significantly easier, but also, unlike C, it works\nin Julia for any type of array (any iterable that provides an ` eltype `\nmethod).\n\nPython (within a Julia Kernel using PyCall)\n\n    \n    \n    py\"\"\"\n    def mysum(a):\n        s = 0.0\n        for x in a:\n            s = s + x\n        return s\n    \"\"\"\n    mysum_py = py\"mysum\"\n    \n\nThe results are\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/RBhSI.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/RBhSI.png)\n\nThere are a few interesting aspects.\n\n  * Starting with C, testing the function on an array of  $10^7$  random numbers in [0,1] gives a result of ≈ 10ms for summing these numbers, which means that we have about 1 billion additions per second. This sounds a lot, but is well below the clock-speed of 2.5GHZ my [ processor ](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i5-7300HQ+%40+2.50GHz&id=2922) has. This is because each Floating-Point addition needs to perform several additional calculations to load the next element of the array from memory, plus the time needed to access memory itself. \n  * Probably most interesting is that Python's built in sum is fairly slow, even though the Python sum function is written in C (Julia's sum is built using only Julia). It takes almost 4x longer than the equivalent C code and allocates memory. Python code pays a price for being generic and being able to handle arbitrary iterable data structures. See above for memory allocation differences between Julia and Python. Therefore, there are not only the computations involving addition, but also the overhead from fetching each item from memory. \n  * Julia equivalent of a Python list is a Vector{Any}: internally, this is an array of pointers to \"boxes\" that can hold any type (Any). This makes things much slower: each + computation on an Any value must dynamically look up the type of object, figure out what + function to call, and allocate a new \"box\" to store the result. If you run this logic in Julia, it is even slower than Python. This is the same problem as with the manual Numpy array implementation. Python is faster (better optimized for dealing) with untyped ` Any ` values. This is because Julia expects you to use \"concretely\" typed arrays in all performance-critical cases and why you should always avoid abstract types in Julia. \n  * On the other hand, Numpy arrays can take advantage of the fact that all of the elements are of the same type. This is actually faster than C! The reason is that NumPy gets and extra turbo boost from exploiting [ SIMD instructions ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) . \n\nYou can run SIMD for C as well as Julia as well.\n\nJulia\n\n    \n    \n    function mysum(A)\n        s = zero(eltype(A)) \n        @simd for a in A\n            s += a\n        end\n        return s\n    end\n    \n\nC\n\n    \n    \n    const Clib_fastmath = tempname()   # make a temporary file\n    \n    # The same as above but with a -ffast-math flag added\n    open(`gcc -fPIC -O3 -msse3 -xc -shared -ffast-math -o $(Clib_fastmath * \".\" * Libdl.dlext) -`, \"w\") do f\n        print(f, C_code) \n    end\n    \n    # define a Julia function that calls the C function:\n    c_sum_fastmath(X::Array{Float64}) = ccall((\"c_sum\", Clib_fastmath), Float64, (Csize_t, Ptr{Float64}), length(X), X)\n    \n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/ZoFTDl.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/ZoFTDl.png)\n\nHowever, once you work with SIMD, you really need to know what you do when you\nimplement and use this. Incorrect use of the @simd macro may cause unexpected\nresults.\n\nWhile this may sound like esoteric computer science stuff, you can look at the\n[ following question ](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/63891/54838) to see\nwhat can happen with floating point math results in a reasonable normal\nsituation. The most intriguing example demonstrating the dangers of floating\npoint math I have seen so far comes from [ Stefan Karpinksi\n](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/array-ordering-and-naive-summation/1929) .\nYou can use this to illustrate the difference between left-to-right summation\nand left-to-right summation with a @simd annotation.\n\nEssentially, if you use this code snippet in Julia,\n\n    \n    \n    function sumsto(x::Float64)\n        0 <= x < exp2(970) || throw(ArgumentError(\"sum must be in [0,2^970)\"))\n        n, p₀ = Base.decompose(x) # integers such that `n*exp2(p₀) == x`\n        [floatmax(); [exp2(p) for p in reverse(-1074:969) if iseven(n >> (p-p₀))]\n    \n        -floatmax(); [exp2(p) for p in reverse(-1074:969) if isodd(n >> (p-p₀))]]\n    end    \n    \n    s = rand()*10^6\n    v = sumsto(s)\n    \n\nyou order the random vector (10^6) from highest to lowest value. None of the\nstandard algorithms in Julia or Python provide the true sum, although\ninterestingly, in this example SIMD comes closest in this case. The reason is\nthat in the case of summation, strict left-to-right summation is actually one\nof the least accurate algorithms, so putting @simd on the loop makes it faster\nand more accurate at computing the true sum because SIMD largely allows for\nreassociation of mathematically associative operations which are not actually\nassociative in floating point. This includes ` + ` and ` * ` . Generally, ` (a\n+ b) + c ` can be evaluated as ` a + (b + c) ` instead, but this does not\ncompute the same thing for floating-point values.\n\nThe correct answer can be obtained with the [ Kahan-Babuska-Neumaier (KBN)\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm) summation algorithm\nfor computing sums (and cumulative sums). This comes at a speed difference of\nabout 20x, which is why none of the conventional implementations uses it.\n\nBottom line is, in my opinion, that Julia is serving a niche market. While the\npaper states that Julia comes with a great mix of speed and usability, the\nmain problem is that it is still quite a task to reach C (C++ or Fortran\nspeed) in Julia. If you require real speed, firms will prefer C++ (at least in\nmy field, quant finance, C++ is the by far most frequently used language, with\nsome niche products like OCAML used by Lexifi or Bloomberg's DLIB, which focus\non complex derivs). Most users don't need that speed because the models are to\nsmall, or the data is not big enough. E.g. an everyday Bloomberg user could\nnever download as much data (BBG has a limit on daily data usage) that it\nreally makes a noticeable difference, just like ~150 seconds (compared to 2 in\nJulia) don't make a huge difference if you run a DSGE model because there is\nno need to rerun it every 3 minutes or at even shorter periods.\n\nThat said, packages are really developing in Julia, and charting\nfunctionalities and the DataFrames package are really well done. You can look\n[ here ](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/69780/54838) to see how little code\nis needed to make some kinda decent interactive charts (dynamic option PnL\ncharts).\n\nAlso, since the release of 1.0, you don't usually face issues with breaking\ncode due to deprecation anymore. If everyday datasets grow, and computational\npower becomes more important for casual programmers, Julia could very well\nbecome a big player (subjective opinion)."},

This is a summary of the [ notes\nof Ben Williams\n](https://benjamindwilliams.weebly.com/uploads/6/8/5/7/68575765/notesonforbiddenregressions.pdf)\n\nConsider a (nonlinear) first stage regression of  $X$  on the instruments  $Z$\ngiving fitted values (e.g. using a log-log specification):  $$ \\hat X = \\hat\n\\mu(Z) $$  Consider the structural (causal) equation:  $$ Y = X'\\beta + u $$\nWhat you propose is to use  $\\hat X : \\hat \\mu(Z)$  instead of  $X$  in the\nsecond stage. This gives:  $$ \\begin{align*} \\hat \\beta &= (\\hat X' \\hat\nX)^{-1} \\hat X Y,\\\\\\ &= (\\hat X' \\hat X)^{-1} \\hat X (X' \\beta + u),\\\\\\ &=\n(\\hat X' \\hat X)^{-1} \\hat X (\\hat X' \\beta) + (\\hat X' \\hat X)' \\hat X'(X -\n\\hat X)'\\beta + (\\hat X' \\hat X)^{-1}\\hat X u,\\\\\\ &= \\beta + \\underbrace{(\\hat\nX' \\hat X)' \\hat X'(X - \\hat X)'\\beta}_A + \\underbrace{(\\hat X' \\hat\nX)^{-1}\\hat X u}_B, \\end{align*} $$  If  $Z$  is a valid instrument, on can\nexpect that the  $B$  vanishes as  $\\hat X = \\hat \\mu(Z)$  and by assumption\n$\\mathbb{E}(u|Z) = 0$  .\n\nNow the  $A$  terms is the real problem. Notice that we can always write:  $$\nX = \\mathbb{E}(X|Z) + \\eta,\\\\\\ \\text{ with } \\mathbb{E}(\\eta|Z) = 0 $$  (here\n$\\eta$  is simply  $X - \\mathbb{E}(X|Z)$  ).\n\nThen taking the middle part of the  $A$  term gives:  $$ \\hat X'(X - \\hat X) =\n\\hat X'(\\mathbb{E}(X|Z) - \\hat X) + \\hat X'\\eta,\\\\\\ $$  The last term should\nvanish as  $\\mathbb{E}(\\eta|Z) = 0$  . The first term however, will (in\ngeneral) only vanish if  $\\hat X = \\hat \\mu(Z)$  is consistent for\n$\\mathbb{E}(X|Z)$  , which will be the case if  $\\mu(Z)$  is a correct\nspecification of  $\\mathbb{E}(X|Z)$  .\n\nThe usual 2SLS however is consistent as in this case:  $$ \\hat X =\nZ(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X. $$  Then:  $$ \\begin{align*} \\hat X'(X - \\hat X) &=\nX'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'(X - Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X),\\\\\\ &= X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X -\nX'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X,\\\\\\ &= X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X - X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X = 0\n\\end{align*} $$  So either you do normal 2SLS, which will be consistent if\n$Z$  is uncorrelated with  $u$  or you can use what is called indirect least\nsquares.\n\n  1. Regress  $X$  on  $Z$  using a nonlinear regression (e.g. loglinear regression). \n\n  2. Use the fitted values  $\\hat X = \\hat \\mu(Z)$  as instruments themselves in a 2SLS of  $Y$  on  $X$  . So run 2SLS with instruments  $\\hat X = \\hat \\mu(Z)$  instead of  $Z$  . As  $\\mu(Z)$  is a function of  $Z$  , we also have that  $\\mathbb{E}(u|\\mu(Z)) = 0$  , so these should be valid instruments."},

The owners of ABC can set up another parent company, let’s\nsay ABC global in some tax haven like Luxembourg. Afterwards they can transfer\nsome intellectual property (or other difficult to value assets - typically\nsome intangibles) to the ABC global.\n\nThen when ABC Sweden manages to have to have let’s say 100,000€ profit, the\nLuxembourg based ABC global will decide to lease the intellectual property (eg\nlogo) to ABC Sweden for 100,000€. This extra cost will cause ABC Sweden to\nhave zero profit in Sweden while now ABC global in Luxembourg gets 100,000€\nprofit that now will be taxed there at the their very low corporate taxes.\n\nThe above is just an oversimplified example of course, the methods how this is\ndone are always evolving as government regulators always play cat and mouse\ngame with corporations. If you want to know more details you can have look at\ntopics such as transfer pricing (see [ Alles,& Datar, 1998\n](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2350664) or [ Hirshleifer, 1956\n](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Srikant-\nDatar/publication/227447111_Strategic_Transfer_Pricing/links/09e41510fb40bca7f8000000/Strategic-\nTransfer-Pricing.pdf) ).\n\nAlternatively, and this what is directly referenced in that article, the\nparent company even can be located in the US, and just let it’s foreign\ndaughter companies to reinvest profits they earn in each individual foreign\nmarket (eg use that profit to buy new building, invest in R&D etc, or to build\na war chest). This still makes sense for the company, as A) doing so still\nmakes company more valuable and thus increases shareholder value, B) if they\nbuild a war chest they can always bring that money home at some unspecified\nfuture if US decides to lower its taxes (like the [ Trump tax cuts\n](https://www.google.nl/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/03/27/us-companies-bring-\nhome-665-billion-in-overseas-cash-last-year.html) ).\n\nAgain the above is only very rough sketch of how this is done, the details\nalways evolve following current tax regulations that are changing virtually\nevery year in some small or bigger way around the world.\n\n> Can you explain how this works and why it is considered bad by some people\n> on the left specifically?\n\nThis is not an economics question but moral question, so you would do better\nto ask this on philosophy stack exchange. This being said in short, answer\nwhether the above is bad or ok depends on your moral framework. On a\nfundamental level this is not much different from ordinary people also trying\nto optimize their tax rates by taking advantage of various loopholes (eg\npeople trying to claim as many deductions as possible or people avoiding VAT\nby having friend with a business buy them the product for them - since\nbusiness get VAT rebates). So if you adopt some deontological (rules/action\nbased) ethics, which says trying to minimize your tax rate (within legal\nbounds) is acceptable, then the (legal)corporate tax optimization should also\nnot be a moral issue.\n\nHowever, the ideology of modern (liberal) left is underlined by Rawlsian moral\nframework (or at least in literature that’s the basis for it, I doubt that\nmost people on either left or right know any moral philosophers) which is\ngoverned by consequentialist Max-Min principle (although Rawls full framework\nhas [ non-consequentialist elements\n](https://faculty.washington.edu/wtalbott/phil410/trrawls.htm) so technically\nit is a hybrid moral framework for economics the Max-Min rule is the most\nrelevant part). Under this ethical system actions are good if they help to\nmaximize welfare for the poorest members of society. So under the Max-Min\nprinciple it’s consequences that matter not rules. Taking advantage of tax\nloopholes is fine if you are poor, but if you are rich corporation it is bad\nas resources from those taxes could be redistributed to the poor (assuming\nthat the parameters of economy are such that this would still increase the\nwelfare of poor eg we are not already at the point where taxes are so high\nthat extra taxes cause so much distortions to the economy that it lowers\nwelfare of poor more than they gain from extra redistribution)."},

On the BGP (in\nthe absence of shocks), key indicators growth at the same constant rate. For\nexample, GDP, household consumption, investment all grow at 2% a year. This is\nconsistent with constant steady-state ratios of the indicators over GDP, for\nexample  $\\frac{K}{Y}$  and  $\\frac{C}{Y}$  would be constant, while\nindicators grow at the same rate.\n\nThe rate itself is often built in as an assumption, based on economic priors\nand analysis done outside of the DSGE model (for example estimates of labor-\nproductivity growth). Because of this fact, forecast of equilibrium growths\nare not just boring, but not really forecasts. However, an economy is hardly\never on its balanced growth path, so the strength of these models is in\ndescribing the dynamics back towards equilibrium, for example after a shock to\nglobal oil prices. Immediately after the shock hits, investment will typically\nfall at a faster rate than GDP, and then grow faster after the impact has\nbottomed out.\n\nNote that these models need to be related to actual data via estimation, often\nusing the Kalman Filter to identify unobservable variables, such as the output\ngap, and shocks (such as a technology shock).\n\nTo see how data can be related to model variables, consider the measurement\nequation (assuming the use of a Kalman filter).  $Y$  is actual GDP in\nquarterly frequency,  $\\hat{y_t}$  is the deviation of output from its trend\nlevel at time  $t$  , and 2% is the assumed annual growth rate. Then this can\nbe fed into the model as  $$ \\log Y_t - \\log Y_{t-1} - 0.005 = \\hat{y}_t -\n\\hat{y}_{t-1} $$  This means in particular that the model solution can be\ntranslated back into numbers that are consistent with actual data and hence\n_can be used for forecasting_ .\n\n_References:_ For an overall good and detailed example, see the [ ECB's New\nArea Wide Model ](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp944.pdf) .

Foreign debt is usually (but not always) also denominated in foreign currency. In the past sometimes people even used words 'foreign debt' and 'debt denominated in foreign currency' interchangeably ( [ Vasishtha, 2007 ](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wp07-33.pdf) ) even though that of course is not accurate as you can have foreign debt denominated in domestic currency, and domestic debt denominated in foreign currency. Still just the fact that some scholars sometimes slipped and used the terms interchangeably indicates that often foreign owned debt is denominated in foreign currency. Such debt is more difficult to manage because it can't be easily monetized. \n\n  2. Foreign and domestics creditors are different, for many countries, foreign investors will be large international hedge funds or other governments or international organizations like IMF, whereas domestic creditors are typically domestic firms or individuals. It is easier for large international organization to try to sue government, or to do reputational damage to the government which will make its future borrowing costs higher ( [ Vasishtha, 2007 ](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wp07-33.pdf) ). \n\nOn the other hand, domestic creditors are at the mercy of the government.\nSince from creditor's perspective the government debt is an asset, government\ncan always decide to raise taxes on the income domestic creditors earn from\nthese assets (thereby recouping portion or all interest paid on the domestic\ndebt), or levy some wealth tax that will in effect force domestic creditors to\nin effect hand portion of their assets (and debt is an asset for creditor) to\nthe government. To be fair in principle there are ways how domestic government\ncan tax foreign entities as well but it's much more difficult (see discussion\nof that in [ Gros 2011 ](https://voxeu.org/article/external-versus-domestic-\ndebt-euro-crisis) )."},

For example, as discussed in [\nKlump et al (2011) ](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1294.pdf)\n[emphasis mine]:\n\n> Until recently, the application of production functions with non-unitary\n> substitution elasticities (i.e., non Cobb Douglas) was hampered by empirical\n> and theoretical uncertainties.

Normalization essentially implies representing the production\n> function in consistent indexed number form. **Without normalization, it can\n> be shown that the production function parameters have no economic\n> interpretation since they are dependent on the normalization point and the\n> elasticity of substitution itself** . This feature significantly undermines\n> estimation and comparative-static exercises, among other things.\n\nThe above issue leads to bias in estimation (especially in parametric models)\nso its quite a serious issue. This is because, we can only use observable data\nfor estimation but capital and labor are measured in completely different\nunits (aside from the problem that we actually have no way of accurately\nmeasuring capital in the first place). CES or Cobb-Douglass with unitary fixed\nelasticity gets around the issue by the virtue of elasticity of substitution\nbeing 1, and because the differences in units get absorbed into the scaling\nconstant.\n\nBut what even more, as the above cited paper discussed, the problem of\nnormalization was essentially solved for CES even with non-unitary\nelasticities making it even so more desirable function to use. This is quite\nimportant since empirically elasticity of substitution is generally below\nunity (e.g. have a look at [ Chirinko et al. 1999\n](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272799000249?casa_token=2-aYd3UIB1oAAAAA:S_dVDrAU0IptuS1-HZRgyVQ2ila5vbSTiw5ZTF_erpUFvZol2xmJdY9Qvmt-\nq_mXxQzXdp74r5Q) , [ Klump et al. 2007 ](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-\nabstract/89/1/183/57638/Factor-Substitution-and-Factor-Augmenting) , [ Leon-\nLedesma et al. 2010\n](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.4.1330) ).\n\nLastly, estimation of production functions is riddled beyond belief with\nendogeneity issues. One way how to solve the endogeneity issues is to look to\ntheory for guidance of how to set up model (especially how to properly specify\nthe error term) to avoid these issues (e.g. see the work of [ Olley Pakes 1996\n](https://web.archive.org/web/20211112161908/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2171831?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\n, [ Levinsohn-Petrin 2000 ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w7819) or [ Ackerberg,\nCaves and Frazer 2015\n](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA13408?casa_token=YITxPu4O2wIAAAAA:_unIEQBPoYb8iN9nOKznktKIty_F4MYARvYO2UkwTKD93PSMR3jUOWt6PQqOreVP4MYenrWaUP4F\n--o) ). But lot of these theoretical results are derived assuming CES\nproduction function, so you can't just use theoretical result derived assuming\nCES production to model the structure of the error term and nothing else.\n\n>   2. are there any serious papers or methods that allow for a non-CES\n> production function?\n>\n\nWell yes, there are a lot of papers that apply translog production function\nwhich allows elasticity of substitution to change ( [ Heathfield, Wibe 1987\n](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-18721-8_6) ). If you\njust put [ translog production function estimation into google scholar\n](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&q=translog%20production%20function%20estimation)\nyou will get a lot of examples.\n\nHowever, estimating translog production function parametrically can be\nproblematic because relative to CES or Cobb-Douglass you have to estimate\nquite a lot of parameters to make it work. Especially if you want to include a\nlot of factors of production the number of parameters virtually explodes\n(Pavelescu, 2011), and this is a problem given the tendency of including more\nand more factors in recent years (e.g. materials, different types of capital\nand so on)."},

Fed is not just\ncentral bank but also research institution and it does banking regulation and\nsupervision. Adam Smith, contrary to widely held beliefs was not principally\nanti-regulation, in fact in WoN he supports all sorts of pragmatic regulations\nsuch as the act of navigation which he rigorously defended.\n\nAs argued by [ Reisman (1998) ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752070)\n[emphasis mine]:\n\n> Adam Smith was not a single-minded advocate of a laissez-faire market in\n> which the minimal State had no more than a protective function.

In addition, central bank does not fulfill the same role in\npresent day fiat monetary system as it did under gold standard. Again, save of\nhaving time machine we can just conjecture how he would respond to that. Smith\nin his writing does not directly address fiat money systems, these became\ncommonplace only during 20th century (there are arguably few historical\nexceptions (see Peter Bernholz (2003). Monetary Regimes and Inflation:\nHistory, Economic and Political Relationships) but Smith does not discuss\nthese, and he might not have been even aware of such systems.\n\n> Does ... Capitalism support a Central Bank/Federal Reserve?\n\n  1. Capitalism is name for economic/social system. A system has no will it cannot support anything. That is like asking if solar system supports banning smoking in public places. \n  2. If you are interested in knowing if having central bank is consistent with capitalism that depends on your definition of capitalism. The word capitalism is typically not used in economics as it is very poorly defined and it can mean anything (there are scholars that consider [ USSR capitalist ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) country). For example, Mankiws principles of economics have word capitalism printed only three times (in a textbook of over 850 pages), and all of those three times, two are quotes from newspapers and one is from a quote from Churchill used in introduction to one chapter. \n\nHowever, if you wish to use the dictionary definition of capitalism (from [\nMerriam-Webster ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism) ):\n\n> : an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of\n> capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and\n> by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined\n> mainly by competition in a free market\n\nthen central banks or Fed are fully consistent with capitalist system. The\ndescription above talks about system that is just characterized by private\nownership, and where the distribution of goods is _mainly_ determined by\ncompetition in free market. Thus, having central bank or even whole sectors\nlike let's say healthcare, controlled by government is fully consistent with\ncapitalism provided the economy _mainly_ relies on free market.\n\nHowever, under some different specific definitions of capitalism the above may\nnot hold. Since capitalism is poorly defined and value laden term it is best\nto just avoid it as done throughout most of modern economic literature (or if\nyou have to use it it is best to refer to some specific definition)."},

In\neconomics, when it comes to equity, the most focus is placed on income, wealth\nor consumption inequality (see the discussion in Atkinson (2015) Inequality).\n\nThere are some examples where equity and efficiency go hand in hand. For\nexample, if we consider equity in global sense (not just national) we have\nsolid evidence that free migration is both good for efficiency. It could by\nreasonable estimates double world's GDP (see [ Clemens, 2011\n](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.3.83) ) which would be\ngood for efficiency, and from global perspective it would help to reduce\nworld's income inequality, (albeit it may worsen national-level ones) as it\nwould significantly raise incomes and wealth of poor migrants and thus likely\nreduce global income inequality (see some layman friendly discussion of that\nin [ Peterson 2013 ](https://www.e-ir.info/2013/05/01/international-migration-\nand-global-economic-inequality/) ).\n\nAlternative simple textbook example of situation where there is no equity-\nefficiency tradeoff, would be Pigouvian tax on something consumed\npredominantly by rich, like flying. Flying creates an awful lot of pollution,\nand Pigouvian tax would thus be efficient as it would correct for the\nexternality (that airlines without tax can pollute for free), and to an extent\nthat richer people fly more often, it would probably reduce consumption\ninequality somewhat.\n\nOf course, the ones above are just example, there are more cases. Atkinson\n(2015) source mentioned above has a nice overview of some cases where there is\nlittle or none efficiency equity tradeoff in chapter 9 (although note that in\nearlier chapters he warns that not all examples are generally accepted by all\neconomists since some are controversial).\n\nHowever, covid-19 vaccine program is not necessarily good example of that.\nCovid-19 is particularly dangerous to people who are older ( [ Piroth et al\n2020 ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260020305270) ),\nfor example wealth inequality increases with life expectancy as older people\nare expected to have more wealth due to growth dynamics ( [ Vandenbroucke,\n2016) ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2754973) , and\nwhen old people pass to an extent they have more than one child they spread\nout their wealth around making society more equitable.\n\nWhat even more, as [ Deaton (2021) ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28392)\nargues:\n\n> There is a widespread belief that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased global\n> income inequality, reducing per capita incomes by more in poor countries\n> than in rich. This supposition is reasonable but false. Rich countries have\n> experienced more deaths per head than have poor countries; their better\n> health systems, higher incomes, more capable governments and better\n> preparedness notwithstanding. The US did worse than some rich countries, but\n> better than several others. Countries with more deaths saw larger declines\n> in income. There was thus not only no trade-off between lives and income;\n> fewer deaths meant more income. As a result, per capita incomes fell by more\n> in higher-income countries.\n\nIf equity would be goal, then from global perspective the best course of\naction would be to ship as much vaccines to poor countries and let covid-19\nravage richer countries. What even more, in general research shows that\npandemics like that of bubonic plague in the past or other large catastrophes\n(like large scale wars) were great equalizers (e.g. see [ Alfani 2017\n](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ehr.12652) ; [ Milanovic 2016\n](https://www.nature.com/articles/537479a) ; [ Piketty and Saez 2014\n](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/838.abstract) ), so these\nactually help equity (at least along income and wealth lines). There are some\nthat argue that covid-19 might be somewhat different (e.g. see [ Sayed & Peng\n2021 ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-021-00059-4) ) but it\nis more likely than not that it will reduce inequality globally, at least\nalong wealth and income. However, it is precisely in the rich countries where\npandemic and lockdowns that were imposed as a response to it create the\nlargest efficiency loses so from pure efficiency perspective vaccines are more\nimportant."},

A good paper\nthat tries to answer this question for economics is [ Hudson (2017)\n](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640760/) . As Hudson writes:\n\n> Is economics a science or a social science? Arguments have been made for\n> both orientations, i.e. that economics is a social science (Frey 1999), a\n> science (Frey 1999) and even a moral science (Schabas 2009). In terms of\n> sciences it has been linked with physics, with many physicists doubling as,\n> or transforming into, economists and a subpart of physics, econophysics,\n> specifically evolving which deals with economics (Stanley et al. 1999).\n> There are also links with biology (Marshall 1920; Daly 1968). Frey (1999)\n> argues economics is a social science as it is part of those sciences which\n> deal with actual problems of society, i.e. it is the subject matter which\n> makes it a social science. However, he also points out that in practice\n> economists tend to fill the journals with axioms, lemmas and proofs, i.e.\n> they adopt what they perceive as a scientific, and particularly a\n> mathematical, methodology. Mayer (1980) argues that economists act as though\n> economics is a hard science and this is reflected by their sophisticated use\n> of mathematics. However, he then goes on to argue that econometrics is not\n> sufficiently advanced to enable us to test theories as a hard scientist\n> would.\n\nBut this being said, as mentioned in my first paragraph most would call it\nsocial science as its main focus are societal issues (although you can have 1\nperson Robinson Crusoe economy, typically economies involve large groups of\npeople).\n\n> Why he can make the claim above regarding Type I and Type II in social\n> science?\n\nI do not think there is any rigorous defense of such claim. In any science if\nyou care about the science itself both type I and type II errors are equally\nproblematic. You should ask your professor for why he thinks that, but I do\nnot think that you can rigorously defend such position.\n\nI guess in some _specific_ circumstances you could defend the claim. If we\ntest if some food is poisonous then you should do everything you can about\navoiding type II error (e.g. saying the food is not poisonous when it actually\nis), since if you commit type II error you get someone poisoned, whereas if\nyou commit type I error you just think some safe food is poisonous, but\nassuming you have plenty of other food options that you know are safe you wont\nstarve and you won't kill anyone.\n\nYou could probably set up similar policy scenarios in the subfield of policy\neconomics, but extending that claim about type I and type II error to all\nsocial science or even all economics is hardly defensible (if anything I can\nthink of far more examples from medicine which is not considered social\nscience)."},

Financial deregulation played a significant and\nextremely important role in the Great Recession, but saying it's the primary\ncause of the Great Recession would be exaggeration. It is generally agreed\nthat root causes of the Great Recession were not just financial deregulation\nbut also macroeconomic imbalances, underlying moral hazard issues inherent in\nthe finance sector, past bailouts, changes in the tax code that incentivize\nmore leverage and also some macro policy mistakes. The deregulation was\nadditional catalyst that exacerbate the above but it is generally agreed that\nthat it is very difficult to pin Great Recession on single primary cause (see\nEichengreen Hall of Mirrors, [ Stiglitz 2009\n](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/sites/jstiglitz/files/2009_Interpreting_Causes.pdf)\n, [ Verick et al 2010\n](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1631069) or [\nJagannathan et al 2010\n](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042957312000277?casa_token=BxyUO4ePGIoAAAAA:pBiPcZeUL-2Xtuz9RLZSjPNaafvtetrEtDjFOVp77hbYp1VbmAPg9U7cl8VzFWHQCWzAa3qr45AW)\n). Even when it comes to the deregulation itself, the role of Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act is not settled and disputed (see [ Wallison 2010\n](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-6637-7_2) ). It can be\nargued it contributed to the Too Big To Fail problem that further exhibited\nmoral hazard but far more important was deregulation that allowed banks to\nbecome extremely overleveraged such as SECs 2004 decision to allow more\nleverage or completely somehow letting shadow banks to fly under the radar. In\nfact literature shows universal banks (which were prohibited by Glass-\nSteagall) are not important contributors to financial instability e.g. see [\nDietrich et al 2012\n](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106297691200004X?casa_token=fEMlx7Y85_QAAAAA:yvLSCG6mEqCJWoCIxdUT3v8AYk9m1nOoDjgdbsm4Ee9JwhLsni5dOMApHSCFZOgLIG0MKUnmbi8r)\n).\n\nNow getting to your main question, measuring financial regulation across time\nis tricky business since you cannot simply just count the number of laws.\nHowever, there is consensus that the financial regulation has increased\nsignificantly since 2009 ( [ Rashid, 2019 ](https://mpra.ub.uni-\nmuenchen.de/93447/1/MPRA_paper_93447.pdf) ; [ Tarullo 2019\n](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.1.61) )\n\nSome of the new regulations are similar to the old ones. For example, 2010\nDodd-Frank act can be said to be somewhat inspired by the Glass-Steagall in\nsome provisions, even though as explained by Tarullo (2019) Dodd-Frankt\nlargely eschewed the old regulatory solutions and did not reintroduce\nseparation of commercial and investment banking (as discussed above that is\nlikely not main problem when it comes to financial stability anyway).\n\nConsequently, modern bank regulation is fundamentally different from the old\none (at least in the US), reflecting progress of the science on this issue.\nModern banking regulation places emphasis not just on microprudential\npolicies, but on macroprudential policies, systemic stability, stress testing\netc and the idea of clamping down on universal banking was more or less\neschewed.\n\nFor example, the Dodd-Frank focuses quite a lot on macroprudential policies\nand systemic stability and later amendments (e.g. Collins amendment ) also\npushed for more stringent capital requirements for large banks (Tarullo 2019).\nBasel III (which is international regulation but it affects US as well - at\nleast some provisions do) also significantly improves the capital standards of\nbanks.\n\nMoreover, the stress-test introduced by Dodd-Frank and administered by Fed got\nmore stringent and risk sensitive over time ( Hirtle and Lehnert 2014).\n\nShadow banking is one area where the modern regulation is seriously lacking\n(Tarullo 2019), but that is not to say that Glass-Steagall could solve that\nissue. The problem with shadow banks is that they are technically not banks\neven though they behave like banks and due to various issues such as\nregulatory arbitrage they are extremely difficult to regulate.\n\nConsequently, to sum up yes the financial regulation since the Great Recession\nhas increased, some of the new rules were based on the old, but for most part\nthe old regulatory framework was eschewed because in retrospective it was not\nso great anyway (Glass-Steagall virtually completely ignores macroprudential\nissues which are now agreed to be _extremely_ important). Rather the new\nregulation is based on our current science and understanding of the market\nfailures and issues in the financial sector, which is actually to a certain\ndegree informed by the lessons learned from the Great Recession."},

Notice, however, that in general\n$\\beta_2 \\ne \\delta_2$  (so the coefficients for  $z_1$  will not be equal in\nthe two regressions).\n\nAnother way to see this is by immediately substituting  $x = z_1 + z_2$  into\nthe regression  $(1)$  then:  $$ \\begin{align*} y &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(z_1 +\nz_2) + \\beta_2 z_1 + e,\\\\\\ &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 z_2 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2) z_1\n+ e. \\end{align*} $$  So the coefficient on  $z_2$  in the new regression is\nidentical to the coefficient on  $x$  in the original one  $(\\beta_1)$  ,\nwhile the coefficient on  $z_1$  in the new regression is the sum of the\ncoefficients on  $x$  and  $z_1$  in the original regression  $(\\beta_1 +\n\\beta_2)$  .\n\n> And a follow up question is: if  $z_1$  is correlated with the error term,\n> will including it in the model bias the estimate of  $\\beta_1$  ?\n\nThe opposite is true. Including  $z_1$  into the regression will make the\nestimate of  $\\beta_1$  unbiased. Consider the following data generating\nprocess:  $$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + e, \\tag{2} $$  and assume that  $e$  is\ncorrelated with  $z_1$  . Then we can write:  $$ e = \\gamma z_1 + \\varepsilon.\n$$  where  $\\varepsilon$  is now uncorrelated with  $z_1$  . (and where\n$\\gamma = \\mathbb{E}(e z_1)/\\mathbb{E}((z_1)^2) \\ne 0$  . Assume for\nsimplicity that  $e$  is uncorrelated with  $z_2$  .\n\nThen the estimate of  $\\beta_1$  will be biased as the orthogonality condition\n$\\mathbb{E}(e x) = 0$  is not satisfied. Indeed:  $$ \\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(ex) &= \\mathbb{E}(e z_2) + \\mathbb{E}(\\gamma z_1 z_1) +\n\\mathbb{E}(\\varepsilon z_1),\\\\\\ &= \\mathbb{E}(\\gamma (z_1)^2) \\ne 0\n\\end{align*} $$  If we include  $z_1$  into the regression. Then substituting\n$e = \\gamma z_1 + \\varepsilon$  , into  $(2)$  we can write:  $$ y = \\beta_0 +\n\\beta_1 x + \\gamma z_1 + \\varepsilon. $$  And  $\\mathbb{E}(\\varepsilon) =\n\\mathbb{E}(\\varepsilon x) = \\mathbb{E}(\\varepsilon z_1) = 0$  . So by\nincluding  $z_1$  into the regression, we can guarantee the residual\n$\\varepsilon$  to be uncorrelated with all covariates. This means that\n$\\beta_1$  is identified and its estimate will be unbiased."},

I do not know where you heard such argument but it is\nblatantly false.\n\nFirst, it is virtually unanimously agreed by top policy economists that\ngovernment cannot fund arbitrary amount of real spending (i.e. spending on\nreal goods and services). This question was actually put forward in [ a poll\n](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/) among the top\nIvy league US economists by IGM and there was almost unanimous agreement that\ngovernment cannot do that (in fact there was no one who even agreed that it\ncould just few responses with no opinion, with low confidence, since the poll\nscores that as well).\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/lnWbn.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/lnWbn.png)\n\nSecond, money supply increase does not _necessarily_ cause inflation because\nother variables might push inflation into different direction. For example,\nincrease in money supply can be offset by velocity of money or change in real\noutput etc. However, money supply increase, _ceteris paribus_ , _does_ cause\ninflation.\n\nNumerous studies including [ Frain (2004)\n](https://www.esr.ie/ESR_papers/vol35_3/Vol%2035_3Frain.pdf) or [ DeGrauve &\nPolan (2005)\n](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9442.2005.00406.x)\nshow that there is causal relationship between inflation and money supply.\n\nYou can also see that just by plotting money supply growth against inflation.\nIn the figure below on a left you can see the relationship between money\nsupply growth and inflation in the US over several years, on a right you can\nsee cross-sectional plot of money supply growth and inflation across various\ncountries. The images of course only show correlation, but causality is\nfurther corroborated by empirical studies as those cited above (the charts are\ntaken from Mankiw Macroeconomics 8ed pp 107-108).\n\n[ ![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/rR4aUm.png)\n](https://i.sstatic.net/rR4aUm.png) [ ![enter image description\nhere](https://i.sstatic.net/rJPhpm.png) ](https://i.sstatic.net/rJPhpm.png)\n\nThere is very little doubt in empirical research that there is relationship\nbetween money growth and inflation. There are still questions on how strong\nthe relationship is, and how stable the relationship is over time, which is\ndiscussed in the studies cited above, but either evidence points toward causal\nrelationship.\n\nHowever, this does not mean government cannot monetarily finance _some_ of its\nreal spending, as despite of the above government can still earn seignorage on\nissuing money, and it can take some time before inflation kicks in as the\nrelationship described above is not necessarily immediate but can work with\nlags. As a consequences taxes are necessarily to fund all other real spending\nthat cannot be funded monetarily."},

Aggregate variability of these statistics is\ngoing to be less than the firm level variability. In [ THE GRANULAR ORIGINS OF\nAGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS BY XAVIER GABAIX\n](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Exgabaix/papers/granular.pdf) , he shows that\nif firms are identical and have the output variance  $\\sigma^2$  (variance as\npercent deviations from the mean), then the GDP standard deviation (of\npercentage deviations from the mean) is\n$$\\sigma_{gdp}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n\nThis going to make GDP much less variable than the average firm and\napproximately zero.

While things get much more complicated as we allow for\nheteroskedasticity, serial correlation, clustering, and the like, the basic\nidea remains that you need more observations to shrink the standard errors.\nSince we established that  $\\sigma_{gdp} << \\sigma$  , if we observe firms and\nnations the same number of times (T) and the observations are IID:\n\n$$SE_{gdp}=\\frac{\\sigma_{gdp}}{\\sqrt{T}} << \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{T}} = SE_{i}$$\n\nThat's my argument for why (generally) the standard errors at the national\nlevel should not be larger than at the firm level. I'm 99% sure you can cook\nup examples that flip this result with the right covariance structure.\nNevertheless, it does not have to be the case that standard errors of country\nlevel variables are larger than firm level ones, and in the simplest case, the\nopposite is true."}
